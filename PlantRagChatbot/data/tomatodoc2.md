Executive Summary
 A Pest Management Strategic Plan was developed for tomato grown in Georgia and
South Carolina during a two day workshop held in conjunction with the 2007 Southeast Regional
Fruit and Vegetable Conference on January 5-6, 2007 at Savannah, Georgia. Participants included
scientists from the University of Georgia, Clemson University, growers and crop consultants from
Georgia and South Carolina, and representatives from the Southern IPM Center, EPA and IR4
Southern Region. General information was provided on pests of tomato prior to the meeting, but
the discussion used to rank pests and develop priorities were participant-driven (see contact list in
the acknowledgements). There was a general consensus that existing research, regulatory and
extension agencies provided critical support for tomato production in this region and that further
reduction in services through budget cuts was to be strongly avoided. There was also agreement
that complex pest problems, such as insect-vectored diseases, the loss of methyl bromide soil
fumigant, or pesticide-resistant organisms were difficult to manage and needed research attention
in the short term. Regulatory needs identified in the workshop focused on pesticides, such as
critical use exemptions. The need for extension/education was highlighted both in terms of
preserving traditional outreach methods and enhancing information availability through electronic
formats. The bottom line to the discussion was to provide crop managers with economically
viable tactics to mitigate pest problems along with the pest management decision criteria to know
when and where tactics are to be used to best manage risk. Along with this need was the desire to
understand why certain critical pest problems occur in the first place, i.e., understanding the
events that lead up to a major pest outbreak, so that preventative strategies can be developed.
Keeping in mind that the tomato production in this region occurs in two seasons, spring and fall,
season-specific pest management information that is updated every few years was also deemed
important. The group thought that PMSP priorities should be updated every five years.
 Some of the more critical issues identified in this GA-SC PMSP workshop for research,
regulation and extension are as follows. Research needs to be done on insect-vectored plant
pathogens, including epidemiology and management studies. Economic thresholds, best
management practices, or similar pest management decision criteria need to be established or
refined for major insect, pathogen and weed pests of tomato. Host plant resistance is an important
pest management tactic that should be developed for major diseases and arthropod pests of
tomato. The effect of methyl bromide alternatives on soil-borne disease pathogens and weeds
needs to be investigated to provide economically viable options for soil treatment in plasticmulch productions systems. Pesticide resistance, pest resurgence and other negative consequences
of pesticide use need to be investigated to supplement existing positive efficacy information for a
more balance and informed approach to use. Post harvest pest problems need more research than
is currently being done for tomato. Regulatory priorities include developing a more sciencebased approach to use restrictions such as buffers, and critical use exemptions. Also, pesticide
labeling should continue to promote resistance management and State regulators should monitor
tomato to enforce label restrictions. Information on all pesticide labels and restrictions should be
easily available, i.e., in a user-friendly and searchable database, for end users. Consequences of
label changes that have significant effects on production, such as labels for copper, need to be
documented and considered in labeling of alternatives. Seed-borne and transplant-borne pest
problems should be monitored to reduce the spread of pests. Extension/Education priorities
include web-based and hard-copy publications need to be developed that compile the latest
information on tomato pest management in a user-friendly format which is updated annually.
Funds for such publications need to be made available. This should particularly target information
on high profile pest problems such as thrips-vectored Tomato spotted wilt virus. Even though this
information is important, on-farm demonstrations are critical to the implementation of pest
management programs. Hands-on training is a priority. Pesticide resistance management
education and implementation programs are needed for insect, pathogen and weed pests.

Tomato production regions in Georgia cover the highest to the lowest elevations. The
primary production areas are in the southwestern and south central parts of the state. The
primary counties producing tomatoes in these areas include Decatur, Seminole, Brooks,
Colquitt, Grady, Echols and Tift. However, Rabun County in the far north east corner of
the state also produced a significant amount of tomatoes for the summer market. The
South Carolina production occurs mostly on a few large farms in the Coastal Plain
region. Georgia and South Carolina tomato production experiences quite a different set of
pest problems as compared to southern Florida tomato production, even though there is
some overlap in pest problems between these two regions.
Cultural Practices
Tomato is grown almost exclusively with plastic mulch and drip irrigation and is
produced primarily on loamy sand to sandy loam soil types in the Coastal Plain area.
Those produced in the mountain area are grown on loam to clay loam soils. Planting
dates for spring production range from early March to late March in the Coastal Plain and
from early to late May in the mountains. Most fall production plantings are made in late
July to early August. There is no fall crop in the mountain region. Land prepared for
tomato is limed to a pH of 6.2 to 6.8. Planting sites are deep turned and bedded. Pre-plant
fertilizers, usually about 25 to 40% of total nitrogen and potassium, and all phosphorous
and minor nutrients are incorporated into beds prior to planting. The remaining nutrients
are applied through drip irrigation. A total of 200 to 250 pounds of nitrogen are used per
crop. A total of 90 to 120 pounds of potassium and phosphorous are applied per acre
 6
depending on soil test results. Tomatoes are always transplanted, usually with a starter
fertilizer application that is high in phosphorous. Plant spacing averages six feet between
rows with 22 inches between plants. This arrangement is usually oriented with one row
on beds that are six feet from center to center with plants spaced 22 inches apart in the
row. Irrigation is supplied as needed with the highest demand for water occurring during
fruit set and enlargement. Foliar applications of calcium and boron are commonly applied
to enhance plant growth and reduce the chance of deficiency. Tomatoes in Georgia are
harvested primarily for the vine-ripe market. This means they have attained at least a
mature green stage and show little if any pink or red color. Tomatoes are generally handpicked and taken to a packing house in bin boxes where they are sized and graded before
being packed in 25-pound boxes. Per acre yields average about 1500 to 2000 boxes per
acre on plastic mulch.

Overall Research, Regulatory and Education Priorities for Tomato
Research
1) Basic biology of all of the major pest complexes of tomato should be further elucidated,
especially difficult-to-manage complexes such as insect-vectored plant pathogens.
2) In tomato, we still need to establish economic thresholds and refine existing action threshold
for most pests. For arthropod pests we need to re-examine curative thresholds for Lepidoptera
(e.g. beet armyworm, tomato fruit worm, tobacco hornworm), aphids, thrips (distinct
thresholds for virus transmission prevention or blossom and fruit damage), spider mites,
stinkbugs, other plant bugs. For disease and weed pests, best management practices based on
quantifiable risk continue to be needed. This information is critical for precision agriculture.
3) Host plant resistance studies for diseases, insect vectors, and other pests are sorely needed
since it is a highly desirable pest control tactic that reduces the overall pesticide load.
4) Effect of methyl bromide alternatives on soil-borne diseases—Rhizoctonia, Phytopthora,
nematodes, Pythium is also needed as quickly as possible.
5) Seed-borne diseases such as bacterial spot and seed borne viruses need to be investigated.
6) Effect of methyl bromide alternatives on purslane and other weeds such as morning glory,
nutsedges, and pigweed needs to be studied relative to new chemistries and tactics.
7) Science-based justification for use restrictions (buffers, etc) needs more investigation before
being applied to regulation practices.
8) Other specific research priorities are listed with the pest sections of this report.
Regulatory and Education
1) Pesticide Regulatory decisions should thoroughly consider resistance management concerns.
It is imperative to maintain multiple modes of action for use against key pests. Support for
pesticide resistance management is of vital concern to both growers and the pesticide
industry.
2) Databases for registered pesticides by state and commodity are needed that are highly user
friendly and easily accessible.
3) New miticides with different modes of action (rotations); or other insecticides for same
purpose need to be registered. Again, maintaining multiple modes of action for resistance
management and requiring compliance to regulations designed to stave off resistant pests
should be a priority for regulators.
4) On-site extension visits including hands-on training need more support, not less. It is a
mistake to think that regionalization of services and web-based delivery is an adequate
substitute for traditional extension services.
5) Maintain the local-level (county) delivery system. This was repeated more than once in the
discussion.
6) Consequences of labeling changes of copper (bacterial spot) need to be looked into, i.e.
reduction in number of applications.
7) Web-based and hard copy publications of pest identification and management (that are user
friendly) should be promoted and used by regulators.
8) Support for research on post-harvest problems associated with diseases and other pests need
to be provided. Post harvest pest problems need regulator oversight, not just industry selfregulation.
9) Critical-use exemptions need to be continued for methyl bromide.
10) Provide more funding for research and extension programs targeted at tomato and other
economically important vegetables in Georgia and South Carolina.

Insect General Overview
David G. Riley and Alton Stormy Sparks Jr.
Department of Entomology
University of Georgia
Insect pests can damage tomato throughout the growing season, but severity varies with
location and time of year. While many insects that feed on tomato are only occasional
pests in Georgia and South Carolina, a few species are common pests and occur every
season. The severity of damage to tomato by insect pests is largely due to abundance of
the pests, which is related to environmental conditions. With most insects it is difficult to
predict when outbreaks will occur and even more difficult to predict if control measures
will be required. However, a working knowledge of their habits, careful pest monitoring,
and timely use of effective control measures will enable growers to avoid or at least
reduce the damage they suffer. Thus, tomato is well suited for insect pest management as
long as a wide variety of control tactics are available, including labeling for diverse
insecticide classes, host plant resistance, cultural controls, biological controls and others.
Because a variety of insects may attack tomato, scheduled sprays are frequently
considered for insect management. However, scouting two to three times per week,
allowing for early detection of infestations, and timely application of pest specific control
measures, is the most cost-effective management strategy. Possible exceptions to this are
the management of thrips which vector Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus or fields with a
history of specific pest problems that require preventive control or are difficult to manage
with curative treatments.
When insecticidal control is determined to be necessary, use the Georgia or South
Carolina Pest Management Handbook to aid in selecting the correct insecticide for
control of specific insect pests described in the following text beginning with thrips and
lepidopterous larvae as the highest priority pests and then by tomato stage attacked. The
following discusses insect pests by early mid and late season to illustrate this point.
Insects Attacking Tomato Crop Seedlings (Early Season)
Tomato is typically transplanted from greenhouse plant production sites on the same farm
or from commercial plant producers. Since all of these crops are susceptible to frost
damage, early planting in greenhouses followed by transplanting into the field avoids
freeze damage. This is particularly important for tomato in the spring when early planting
takes advantage of early favorable market windows. It also can avoid early season pests.
Additionally, greenhouse or shade house transplant production concentrates expensive
chemical treatments into a much smaller area and guarantees more uniform plant stands
in the field. Since most of the acreage of these crops is currently in plastic culture, which
is very expensive, plant uniformity is critical to maintaining production efficiency.
However, these types of high input, uniform production practices also can lead to specific
insect problems that can be exacerbated in these controlled environments. For example,
insecticide treatment in greenhouses can concentrate selection for pesticide resistance to
that insecticide if resistant insects survive the greenhouse production and are carried with
transplants to the field. Some of the more easily controlled pests of tomato crop seedlings
 9
are flea beetles [species: tobacco, southern tobacco, pale striped] that cause small shotholes in leaves, wireworms [species: southern potato, tobacco, gulf], or white grubs, that
attack the stem and roots causing the plant to wilt, and cutworms [species: black and
granulate] that clip the plant off at the soil line. The treatment timing for soil insects, such
as wireworms, is usually at bed formation using soil fumigants. For later invading
cutworms, it is at the time that damage is first detected, and for defoliators, it is at 10%
defoliation. Currently, the most difficult early season pest to control is thrips [species:
tobacco, westernflower] that transmit tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) which causes a
severe wilt disease in most solanaceous crops. Tobacco thrips usually settle on tomato
very early in the season beginning at transplant. Control options for this include host
plant cultivars resistant to the virus, metallic reflective mulch (shown to be effective in
tomato), early-season insecticides targeting thrips and reducing thrips feeding at
transplant, and plant activators that chemically induce resistance. Pre-season weed
monitoring for thrips and TSWV can help to predict risk at a given location.
Insects Attacking Tomato Crops during Vegetative Growth and Flowering (MidSeason)
Probably the most severe insect problem in early spring in the Coastal Plain is thrips that
transmit TSWV. Early season, preventative treatments are effective at reducing thrips and
TSWV. However, mid-season insecticide treatments are ineffective for reducing TSWV
and only partially effective against flower thrips to reduce direct damage to the fruit. In
the early spring, usually no Lepidoptera pests attack tomato, but can occur at the end of
the spring season. The main species of Lepidoptera that attack tomato foliage include the
various species of armyworms [beet armyworm, Southern armyworm, yellow-striped
armyworm]. Other Lepidoptera pests include tobacco hornworm, and tomato fruitworm.
Southern armyworm can occur later in the spring and throughout the summer, whereas
beet armyworm, corn earworm, and tobacco hornworm are more prevalent during the late
summer and fall. Other important chewing insects that can occasionally occur on tomato
and eggplant are Colorado potato beetle and vegetable weevil.
Other groups of insects that can reduce the quality of foliage during mid-season in the
spring include aphids [species: potato and green peach] which secrete honeydew thus
promoting the presence of sooty mold on leaves. During early to mid-season in the late
summer and fall, sweetpotato whiteflies can transmit geminiviruses that severely stunt
plant growth and affect fruit quality. Whiteflies also can produce honeydew that results in
sooty mold when adult and nymph numbers are high. Two other foliage feeders that have
been increasing in importance in recent years are spider mites [mostly two spotted] and
less frequently, leafminers. Spider mites can occur in the spring and fall growing seasons.
Insects that should be controlled mid-season to avoid bloom drop and damage to fruit
buds include stink bugs [species: southern, brown and green], leaffooted bugs, and other
plant bugs.
Thresholds for initiating control actions against insect pests in Georgia and South
Carolina closely follow those recommended by UF IFAS at
http://ftsg.ifas.ufl.edu/ACTBOD.HTM and include the one Lepidoptera larva or bug per
 10
six plants threshold prior to fruit formation. The recent exception to this is beet
armyworm which should be controlled early in the season at 1 larva per 40 plants. Thrips
populations greater than 5 per blossom can cause direct damage, but again, most of the
damage occurs at much lower levels when thrips vector TSWV, and this must be
prevented at an earlier plant growth stage. Broad mite thresholds have not been
established for Georgia and South Carolina, but we recommend a single treatment at the
first sign of mite damage.
Insects Attacking Mature Tomato Crops (Late Season fruit feeders)
Insect control becomes critical once developing fruit are present. Most of the Lepidoptera
pests previously mentioned can damage the fruit either by surface feeding or boring
directly into fruit. In Georgia, tomato fruitworm and beet armyworm are both typical
summer pests that bore into tomato fruit. Other occasional pests that can attack the fruit
include: European corn borer, tomato pinworm, and tobacco budworm. Worms that feed
on fruit surfaces after extensive foliar damage late in the season include tobacco
hornworm and various armyworms. The treatment threshold for worms that attack the
fruit is very low. Depending on the amount of scouting done, the presence of worms in
the field usually signals the need for treatment. Another important group of insects that
directly attacks solanaceous fruit are the true bugs (including stink bugs and leaffooted
bugs) that cause a dimpling, speckling and blotchy discoloration of the fruit. This type of
damage often does not become apparent until the fruit begins to ripen (for example, the
pink and red stages of tomato ripening).
An important insect that cause dimpling and scarring of tomato fruit is western flower
thrips. This has been an economically important problem in recent years. Insects that
cause irregular ripening of tomato include whiteflies. This can be directly from whitefly
feeding or indirectly through the transmission of geminiviruses. Thrips vectored tomato
spotted wilt virus also causes distinctive irregular ripening with circular patterns on the
fruit. Spider mite damage to fruit can appear as a bronzing or russeting of the fruit
surface.

Tomato Insect Management Research, Regulatory and Education Priorities
Research
1) The population dynamics of thrips vectors of Tomato spotted wilt virus of tomato
should be further elucidated, particularly with regard to prediction of TSWV
outbreaks and economically viable management practices.
2) Economic thresholds and refinement of existing action threshold for most insect
pests need investigating. Specifically, for arthropod pests we need to re-examine
curative thresholds for Lepidoptera (e.g. beet armyworm, tomato fruit worm,
tobacco hornworm), aphids, thrips (distinct thresholds for virus transmission
prevention or blossom and fruit damage), spider mites, stinkbugs, other plant bugs,
beet armyworm, tomato fruitworm, aphids, thrips (relative to dimpling and scarring
of fruit), spider mites, stinkbugs
3) Host plant resistance studies for disease, insect vectors and other insect pests are
sorely needed since is a highly desirable pest control tactic that reduces the overall
pesticide load.
4) Efficacy trials of insecticides are needed that include behavioral studies, for
example, reduced feeding or settling that reduces pathogen transmission.
5) Production practices and plant nutrition influences on pest populations are needed.
6) Cultural practices for reducing key pests need to be investigated to reduce the
overall reliance on pesticides in vegetables such as tomato.
7) The effectiveness of beneficial insects and interactions with pesticides need further
investigation.
8) Emerging pests, especially due to loss of certain pesticides (including biology and
management) need to be studied.
9) Factors leading to mite outbreaks and mite population dynamics need to be clearly
identified, such as determining if this is an induced pest from pesticide use.
10) Movement and control of pests from surrounding plants and adjacent areas to the
crop production site needs investigation to improve farmscape pest management.
Regulatory
1) Pesticide regulators should promote the dissemination of information on labels
relative to secondary pest outbreaks from the use of certain insecticides.
2) A database for registered pesticides by state and commodity needs to be easily
accessible and user friendly.
3) New miticides with different modes of action (rotations); or other insecticides for
resistance management purposes need to be registered.
4) Application technology for existing and new chemistries (chemigation) needs to
be promoted, but also regulated relative to crop-stage effects, per acre versus
actual target application, etc.
Education
1) Current information on tomato IPM for each State needs to be centrally linked on
a university maintained Tomato IPM website and then linked between States.
 12
2) On-site extension visits including hands-on training need to be maintained and
increased in frequency.
3) Need to maintain local-level (county) delivery system.
4) Need to maintain insect diagnostic services.
5) Need user friendly, web-based (and hard copy) pest identification and
management publications.
6) Training of other government agencies (IPM training) needs to be promoted.
7) Database for registered pesticides by state and commodity needs to be linked with
extension services since they have to answer questions on this all of the time.
8) Fact sheets and training are needed for resistance management (e.g., rotation by
mode of action).
9) Tools for monitoring pests continue to be needed. Scouting is the foundation for
all IPM activities.

Insect Pest-by-Pest Profiles
Pest Name: Thrips (Order: Thysanoptera; Family: Thripidae)
Tobacco thrips (Frankliniella fusca (Hinds))
Western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande))
Flower thrips (Frankliniella tritici and Frankliniella bispinosa)
Onion thrips (Thrips tabaci Lindeman)
Thrips species are the most significant pests on tomato primarily because they vector
tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). Several species infest tomato annually including:
tobacco thrips, Frankliniella fusca, and western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis
both vectors of TSWV. The flower thrips, Frankliniella tritici, infests tomato annually,
but it does not vector TSWV in the field where as Frankliniella bispinosa may to a
limited extent. Adult: The adults are tiny insects, generally measuring only 1 to 2 mm in
length. They have thin bodies and vary in color from near black to straw colored.
Although some species are generally darker than others, color is not a good characteristic
for identification. Adults have two pair of wings that consist primarily of fringe hairs.
Mouthparts pierce plant tissues and remove plant sap, but are frequently described as
rasping. Separation of species requires microscopic examination. Immature stages:
Larval thrips are similar in body structure to adult thrips but lack well developed wings.
Wing pads are visible on prepupae and pupae. Larval thrips are generally lighter colored
than the adults and vary from near white to tan to pink. Life cycle: The life cycle of thrips
is greatly influenced by host plant, temperature, and diet. Females lay from 10 to over
100 eggs dependant on species and host plant. Flower thrips reproduction is greatly
increased with pollen added to the diet. Eggs are placed into plant tissue and generally
hatch in 3 to 5 days, but they can last 10 to 12 days under cold conditions. The two larval
instars are the only feeding immature stages and last 3.6 to 12 days dependant on species
and temperature. The prepupa and pupal stages generally occur in the soil and last 2.5 to
13 days. The life cycle from egg to adult is 2 to 3 weeks during favorable weather but can
be greatly extended during the winter. Adults can live for about one month.
Distribution, damage, and importance: This problem is widespread and severe through
the coastal plain region of the Southeastern USA. While thrips can cause direct damage
to foliage and fruit, their roll as vectors of tomato spotted wilt is of primary concern,
especially in tomato and tomato. Thrips are cryptic in nature, preferring to feed in tight
secluded places such as the plant terminal and blooms. Immatures are rarely seen outside
of these sights. Feeding on foliage causes young leaves to curl upward and gives older
leaves a silvery or speckled appearance. Feeding within blooms on the ovary of flowers
can result in malformed, student or discolored fruit, and oviposition into small fruit can
also cause deformities. Generally, any direct damage is overshadowed by the impact of
TSWV transmission in tomato. Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) is transmitted
exclusively by thrips and especially by western flower thrips and tobacco thrips. The
initial symptoms of this disease are usually a spotting of the leaf, as illustrated in the
photo. This is followed by a wilting of the plant, and by mid season this can clearly be
seen as short plants in the row. The fruit from an infected plant is usually unmarketable
and can display irregular ripening symptoms. This ripening problem can show up after
tomatoes have been treated with ethylene for the ripening process. For this reason,
 14
TSWV infected plants are typically not harvested at all. Thus, every infected plant
represents a total loss in yield for that plant. All the above species can cause mechanical
damage to the foliage and fruit. Damage to the fruit varies from superficial blistering on
immature pods to large brown blisters on mature pods. If the market is weak or the
damage is severe, buyers will reject the tomato. Thrips overwinter in the soil but, can
emerge anytime it is significantly warm in the winter. Thrips may infest seedlings in the
greenhouse and are quick to infest tomato immediately after planting. Populations vary
from year to year but, the greatest numbers generally occur in the blooms during the
spring plantings. Fall plantings are infested at lower levels than in the spring but, TSWV
incidence is higher because thrips populations are exposed to significant virus reservoirs
during the spring and summer. Estimated total losses including cost of control and
damage for thrips in 1997 was $940,000, cost of control at $455,000 and damage at
$485,000. This does not include estimates for losses from TSWV infections.
Chronology: Thrips are present and generally active throughout the year in the coastal
plain. There are 3 to 5 generations in Georgia. In fruiting vegetables, tobacco thrips will
tend to dominate the population prior to blooming as they readily feed and reproduce on
foliage. Flower thrips species populations can increase dramatically in the crops once
blooming and pollen availability increases. Thrips become viruliferous prior to the
growing season, often as they over winter on TSWV weed hosts. Prediction is critical to
tomato spotted wilt management because most of the management options must be
decided on prior to or at planting for most of the aforementioned host crops. These
preseason management options such as elimination of weed host plants of thrips vectors
like common chick weed, must be done at least one month before transplant in the spring.
Even in the fall growing season, decisions on control tactics must be made pre-season.
Control measures used and recommended: Control tactics include host plant resistant
cultivar of tomato, metallic reflective mulch, at-planting insecticide or SAR product
treatments, early season post-transplant insecticides and possibly adjusting planting
density, location and dates to try to avoid TSWV prone areas and/or periods. Thrips
populations can be monitored in a variety of ways including various methods of beating
plants to dislodge thrips into a collection device (styrofoam cup, white tray, sticky trap),
collection of blooms, plant terminal washes for larvae, or colored sticky traps for adults.
UV-reflective plastic mulch has proven useful in suppressing thrips populations and
TSWV. Insecticides are generally used in a preventative method to suppress thrips
populations where TSWV is of concern.
Cultural/mechanical: Host plant resistant cultivar of tomato, metallic reflective mulch,
and possibly adjusting planting density, location and dates to try to avoid TSWV prone
areas and/or periods.
Biological: Predators, such as Orius spp., contribute to control of thrips, but likely do not
affect initial infection of TSWV only secondary infection by reducing the vector
population. Also, parasitic nematodes have been shown to be partially effective.
 15
Chemical: At-planting neonicotinoid insecticides or treatments with SAR products such
as Messenger, as well as early season post-transplant insecticides such as those indicated
below plus methamidophos (Monitor), lambda cyhalothrin (Warrior) and methomyl
(Lannate).
Chemicals used:
• Acetamiprid (Assail) 30SG
• Dinotefuran (Venom) 20 SG
• Spinosad (SpinTor) 2SC
State/local pesticide restrictions or limitations, export issues, etc.: Methamidophos
(Monitor) is 24c, and Warrior and Lannate not labeled specifically for thrips in tomato.
Critical Issues: Insecticide resistance is known to occur in thrips, so insecticide tactics
alone are not sufficient to manage this pest. Timing of use relative to vector activity is
critical. Imidacloprid use at transplant followed by foliar treatments of methamidophos
and lambda cyhalothrin has been partially effective. Metallic mulch can delay tomato
maturity, but consistently provide significant yield increase in when high numbers of
thrips vectors of TSWV are present. Sources of host plant resistance to the virus and
thrips are effective, but more sources are needed.
Research
1) The population dynamics of thrips vectors of Tomato spotted wilt virus of tomato
should be further elucidated (such as the effect of tree pollen on vector numbers in
the spring), particularly with regard to prediction of TSWV outbreaks
2) Host plant resistance needs to be developed as a primary control tactic, but other
tactics such as reflective mulch and insecticide treatments should also be further
evaluated.
Regulatory
1) Pesticide regulators should promote the dissemination of information on labels
relative to secondary pest outbreaks from the use of certain insecticides
Education
1) Current information on thrips-TSWV management in tomato needs to be centrally
linked on a university maintained site such as www.tomatospottedwiltinfo.org

Pest Name: Spider mites (Order: Acari, Family: Tetranychidae)
Twospotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae (Koch))
Carmine spider mite (Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval))
Tumid spider mite (Tetranychus tumidus (Banks))
Spider mites appear to be developing into a more consistent pest in southern Georgia.
They generally feed on the underside of leaves, but can cover the entire leaf surface when
populations are high. The minute eight-legged mites appear as tiny, reddish, greenish, or
 16
yellow moving dots on the undersides of leaves (Figure 27). Because of their size, the
first detection of spider mite infestations is usually damage to the leaves. Leaves of
tomato plants infested with spider mites are initially lightly stippled with pale blotches
(Figure 28). In heavy infestations, the entire leaf appears light in color, dries up, often
turning reddish-brown in blotches or around the edge and may be covered with webbing.
Greatest damage to tomatoes occurs during dry, hot weather which is favorable for
development of extremely large mite populations. Spider mites are also generally
considered a secondary pest, with damaging populations frequently occurring after
application of broad spectrum insecticides. Adult: Adults are 0.4 to 0.5 mm long, with
females being slightly larger, more robust (oval shaped), and more plentiful. Adults have
four pairs of legs with long hairs on the legs. Actively feeding females are clear to
greenish with dark spots on the body (except tumid mite). The tumid mite female is
usually reddish with dark markings. Although color and number of spots is frequently
used for rough identification of spider mite species, accurate identification requires
microscopic evaluation by an expert. Adult female carmine mites are red. Immature
stages: Eggs are whitish, almost clear, and spherical with a diameter of 0.1 to 0.15 mm.
The first instar is called a larva. It is colorless when it hatches, but turns yellowish or
pinkish after feeding. The larva has three pairs of legs. There are two nymphal instars
after the larva called the protonymph and deutonymph. These both have 4 pairs of
prolegs. Each immature stage lasts 1 to 3 days depending on temperature. Near the end of
each stage, there is a non-feeding resting stage called the nymphochrysalis or
protochrysalis (between the larva and protonymph), the deutochrysalis (between the two
nymph stages) and the teliochrysalis (between the deutonymph and adult stages). Life
cycle: Spider mites generally feed and reproduce on the lower leaf surface, but when
populations are high will readily infest the upper leaf surface. Spider mites complete a
life cycle in 8 to 12 days at 30o C and in about 17 days at 20 degrees. Overwintering may
occur on many weed hosts in warmer climates, but females may also overwinter in debris
in a state of diapause. Eggs are laid singularly, with females depositing 5 to 6 eggs per
day, with a total of 60 to 100 eggs per female. Eggs hatch in 3 to 6 days depending on
temperature. Larva and nymphs complete development in 4 to 9 days depending on
temperature and the females have a pre-oviposition period of 1 to 2 days. Adults live
about 30 days.
Distribution, damage, and importance: Sometimes a problem in the fall at various
locations in the coastal plain production region. Spider mites generally feed on the
underside of leaves but will cover the entire leaf surface when populations are high. They
pierce plant cells and withdraw the cell contents. Feeding can result in small clumps of
dead cells that give a speckled appearance of the infested leaves. Wilting, leaf deformity,
desiccation, and abscission occur with prolonged, high density infestations. Disruption of
photosynthesis results in plant stunting and reductions in yield.
Chronology: Spider mites prefer hot dry conditions, so they tend to increase in
population during the summer. They have an extremely wide host range, including
numerous weed hosts, and may be present in the field when vegetables are planted but
seldom require control early in the production season. More typically, they build
 17
populations later in the season and are likely aided by multiple applications of broad
spectrum insecticides which impact natural enemies without controlling spider mites.
Control measures used and recommended: In general, treatments for mite control
should be applied when mites become numerous and their damage appears excessive.
However, some of the newer acaricides are slow acting or effective only on selective
stages of mites. If these acaricides are used, a more preventive approach to management
is required. Where a history of mite problems exists, this preventive approach may be
justified in tomato which is a favored host of spider mites. To check for spider mites,
observe plant foliage for characteristic damage. Look on the undersides of leaves for
mites. Pay close attention to field borders and weedy areas. Mites frequently get started
and reach their highest density along field margins adjacent to roads where the plants are
covered with dust. Spider mites are often considered a secondary pest, with damaging
populations frequently occurring after application of broad spectrum insecticides
(particularly carbaryl and pyrethroids with the exception of bifenthrin and fenpropathrin).
A growing set of data also indicates increased problems with spider mites following soil
applications of neonicotinoid insecticides. While use of these products is frequently
recommended for other pest situations, when spider mites are present in the field,
potential influence on mites should be considered in the decision.
Cultural/mechanical: Mites are often associated with dry conditions.
Biological: Pirate bugs, big eyed bugs, predatory mites and fungi such as Hirsutella
thompsonii (under moist conditions) provide high levels of control of mites. Predacious
mites provide excellent control, including commercially available Phytoseiulus
persimilis.
Chemical: Chemicals are only used when natural control of mites fails (usually because
of other pesticide usage) and populations explode.
Chemicals used:
• Abamectin (Agri-Mek) 0.15EC
• Bifenazate (Acramite) 50WS
• Bifenthrin (Capture) 2EC
• Dicofol (Kelthane) MF and (Dicofol) 4EC
• Spiromesifen (Oberon) 2SC
Critical Issues: There is concern that intensive pesticide usage for other arthropod pests
is the cause for mite outbreaks since mites tend to flare up in intensively treated fields.
Research:
1) Need to determine the cause of mite outbreaks in tomato for possible prevention
Regulatory:
2) None identified
 18
Education:
3) Current information on the causes of outbreaks of this pest and management
options need to be published and disseminated to end users
**************************
Lepidopterous Pest Group
Pest Name: Beet armyworm
(Order: Lepidoptera, Family: Noctuidae Spodoptera exigua (Hubner))
Beet armyworm appears to be becoming a more consistent pest. Historically, it is
considered a secondary pest, with large populations usually occurring only after multiple
applications of broad spectrum insecticides. However, this pest is now a fairly consistent
pest in the summer and fall. Beet armyworms feed on both the foliage and fruit of tomato
plants. Eggs are laid in masses on the undersides of the foliage. Young larvae remain near
the site of hatching, feeding in groups that cause characteristic foliar damage referred to
has ‘hits’. After feeding on foliage for a few days, medium sized larvae (3rd instar) may
migrate to the fruit. They may tunnel into the fruit under the calyx or eat directly through
the fruit wall. Because beet armyworms start as foliage feeders, treatments can be
delayed until hits are detected but should be applied prior to third instar. In practice,
treatments are generally begun with first detection of egg masses or hits. Adult: Moths
are medium sized with a wingspan of 25-30 mm. The forewings are a mottled gray and
brown with irregular banding and a light colored bean shaped spot near the center. The
hind wings are a more uniform white or dirty white with a dark line near the margin.
Immature stages: Eggs are laid in clusters of 50-150, greenish to white and are covered
with a layer of whitish scales that give the egg mass a fuzzy or cottony appearance.
Larvae are pale green to yellow during the first two instars. Larger larvae vary in
appearance. Large larvae tend to be green to dark green dorsally and may have a series of
dashes that give the appearance of longitudinal lines on the back. Large larvae generally
have a dark line along the side of the body with a light line below the dark line. The
underside of large larvae is generally pink or yellow. Life cycle: Egg clusters are usually
deposited on the underside of leaves. Females normally deposit 300-600 eggs during their
lifetime. Eggs hatch in 2-3 days during warm weather. Early instar larvae are gregarious,
feeding as a group and skeletonizing leaves. Larvae are primarily foliage feeders or
surface fruit feeders during the first two instars which require about 4 days. Third instar
larvae disperse and will attack fruit but can complete development on foliage in the
absence of fruit. Normally, larvae develop through 5 instars in 9-10 days. Larvae reach a
maximum size of about 22.5 mm. Pupation occurs in the soil and the pupal stage
generally last 6-7 days. Total generation time is about three weeks.
Distribution, damage, and importance: Mostly a problem in the summer to fall
production season throughout the southern coastal plain, but not consistently a problem in
all years. The first two instar larvae are gregarious and feed in groups on foliage. The
clumped skeletonizing of foliage is known as a beet armyworm ‘hit’ in many crops. Third
and later instar larvae disperse and may continue feeding on foliage but will bore into
fruit.
 19
Chronology: Beet armyworm generally does not overwinter in Georgia but can migrate
readily from Florida. While the potential from significant infestations are more likely in
the fall, this pest can be a problem in the spring production season as well. This pest is
generally considered a secondary pest, with significant infestations usually occurring
only after repeated use of broad spectrum insecticides which decimate its parasites and
have little impact on the beet armyworm because of resistance to older insecticide
chemistries.
Control measures used and recommended: Beet armyworms are generally controlled
with insecticides when they appear in significant numbers during the growing season.
Beet armyworm moths can be monitored with pheromone traps, but adult abundance does
not always correlate with subsequent larval problems. Scouting for beet armyworms
generally involves inspection of foliage for egg masses, larvae, and ‘hits’. Egg masses
can be difficult to locate because of their clumped nature. In fruiting vegetables,
insecticide applications based on the detection of ‘hits’ generally provides ample
protection as the early instars do not attack fruit and ‘hits’ can be detected prior
to fruit loss.
Cultural/mechanical: Mostly be aware that the beet armyworm populations are
seasonal, generally a summer to fall problem, not a spring problem.
Biological: Bacillus thuringiensis, Nomuraea rileyi, and nuclear polyhedrosis viruses are
effective against beet armyworm and preserve beneficial predators such as the spined
soldier bug and parasitoids like braconid wasps.
Chemical: Newer chemistries (such as the soon to be registered metaflumizone) tend to
be more effective than older chemistries since older insecticides have had resistance
problems in the pasts in the southern USA, but this is not always the case.
Chemicals used:
• Emamectin benzoate (Proclaim) 5WDG
• Indoxacarb (Avaunt) 30WDG
• Methoxyfenozide (Intrepid) 2F
• Spinosad (SpinTor) 2SC
State/local pesticide restrictions or limitations, export issues, etc.: 24 c for

Pest Name: Other armyworms (Order: Lepidoptera, Family: Noctuidae)
Southern armyworm (Spodoptera eridania (Cramer))
Yellowstriped armyworm (Spodoptera ornithogalli (Guenée))
Adult: Southern armyworm moths are medium sized with a wingspan of 33-38 mm, while
yellowstriped armyworm moths have a wingspan of 34-41 mm. The forewings of both
are grayish brown with light and dark colored markings. The hind wings are a more
uniform white or with a narrow brown margin. Immature stages: Eggs are laid in clusters
of 200-500, greenish to white and are covered with a layer of whitish scales that give the
egg mass a fuzzy or cottony appearance. Southern armyworm eggs have ribs which
radiate out from the center. Larvae are pale green to yellow during the first two instars.
Larger larvae of both species are similar in appearance. Large southern armyworms are
tan brown to dark green with a reddish brown head. They have white lines on the back
and additional stripes on the side interrupted by a dark spot on the first abdominal
segment. The yellowstriped armyworm has two yellow colored bands down each side of
the back with a series of strong black triangular markings down either side. The head
capsule tends to be darker than the southern armyworm. Life cycle: Egg clusters are
usually deposited on the underside of leaves. Females normally deposit 200-500 eggs
during their lifetime. Eggs hatch in 3-6 days during warm weather. Early instar larvae are
gregarious, feeding as a group and skeletonizing leaves. Larvae are primarily, if not
entirely, foliage feeders but can attack the fruit, feeding primarily on the surface.
Normally, larvae develop through 6 instars in 14-20 days. Larvae reach a maximum size
of about 35 mm. Pupation occurs in the soil and the pupal stage generally last 11-18 days.
Total generation time is about one month.
Distribution, damage, and importance: Mostly in summer to fall production seasons
and occasionally late spring, but not consistently. The first two instar larvae are
gregarious and feed in groups on foliage. The clumped skeletonizing of foliage is known
as an armyworm ‘hit’ in many crops. Third and later instar larvae disperse and may
continue feeding on foliage but can also scar the surface of the fruit.
Chronology: Armyworms generally do not overwinter in Georgia but can migrate
readily from Florida. There is an estimated four generations per year in Florida. While the
potential from significant infestations are more likely in the fall, this pest can be a
problem in the spring production season as well. This pest is generally considered a
secondary pest, with significant infestations usually occurring only after repeated use of
broad spectrum insecticides which decimate its parasites and have little impact on the
armyworm because of resistance to older insecticide chemistries.

**************************
Pest Name: Sweetpotato and silverleaf whitefly (Order: Hemiptera, Family:
Aleyrodidae, Bemisia tabaci or argentifolii - silverleaf) Adult: The adult is small, about
0.9 to 1.2 mm in length and holds its solid white wings roof-like over a pale yellow body
while at rest. Immature stages: Immature stages begin with a pointed oblong yellow egg
(0.2 mm) which darkens at the apex just before hatching. The first instar or crawler stage
(0.2-0.3 mm) settles down on the underside of leaves close to the egg shell and goes
through three more molts as a sessile, flattened oval nymph. Late third and fourth instars
begin to develop eye spots and are often referred to as red-eyed nymphs. The last instar,
or "pupal stage" (0.7-0.8 mm), has very distinct eye spots. Life cycle: The life cycle from
egg to adult may be 18 days under warm temperatures (86o
F) but may take as long 2
months under cool conditions. The number of eggs produced is also greater in warm
weather than in cool weather. The rate of reproduction ranges from 50 to 400 eggs (avg.
160, of which about ⅔ are female) per generation, hence a high capacity for reproduction.
Distribution, damage, and importance: Mainly a late summer and fall problem, but
can be widespread and if geminiviruses are present, it can have widespread severe impact
on tomato. In tomato crops in Texas, economic loss has almost only been associated with
the transmission of geminiviruses which can render tomato plant unproductive. If
whitefly transmitted viruses are not present, then yield losses are not likely with light
infestations of an average of less than 6 adults per leaf.
Chronology: In Georgia, whiteflies are generally not an economic problem in the spring
growing season, unless the production is in an infested greenhouse. In the late summer
and fall, whiteflies numbers increase dramatically in some years.
Control measures used and recommended: Use preventative management first and
only curative insecticide treatments when geminivirus is present or populations
consistently exceed and average of 6 adults per leaf.
Cultural/mechanical: The lack of host plant material can cause abrupt declines in
whitefly populations. Thus removal of infested plant residue is important in the
management of this pest. If delayed planting can be used in the fall, planting after
whitefly migrations (often associated with cotton defoliation) have declined should be
practiced.
Biological: Natural sources of mortality for the whitefly include predation by beneficial
insects such as lacewing or coccinelid larvae, parasitization by wasps such as Encarsia or
Eretmocerus species, mechanical injury, desiccation, insect pathogens such as Beauvaria,
Paecilomyces or Verticillium species
Chemicals: The neonicotinoids have been the mainstay of whitefly control in vegetables
for the last decade. This is usually applied preventatively in the fall (when whiteflies are
more prevalent) as a soil drench or drip injection at the time of transplant.
 23
Chemicals used:
• Acetamiprid (Assail) 30SG

• Dinotefuran (Venom) 20SG
• Pyriproxyfen (Knack) 0.86EC
• Spiromesifen (Oberon) 2SC
• Thiamethoxam (Actara) 25WG
Critical Issues: Whiteflies are occasionally important in Georgia and South Carolina as
vectors of geminivirus. Also, Q-strain whitefly has been found in greenhouses which is
resistant to neonicotinoid insecticides
Research:
1) Need to evaluate the effectiveness of whitefly control tactics in terms of reducing
geminivirus transmission
2) Need to monitor for Q-strain whitefly and develop a management strategy if it
becomes prevalent.

Education:
4) Current information on whitefly management needs to be disseminated to end
users if geminivirus and or Q-strain whiteflies become prevalent
***********************
Pest Name: Leafminers (Order: Diptera, Family: Agromyzidae)
Vegetable leafminer (Liriomyza sativae (Blanchard))
Liriomyza trifollii (Liriomyza trifollii (Burgess))
Adult: Leafminer adults are tiny yellow and black flies. The yellow markings on the head,
thorax, and legs are useful in identifying species. The abdomen is mostly gray and black.
Adults are less than 2 mm long with a wing span of less than 2 mm. Wings are
transparent. Immature stages: Eggs are oval, small, and change color from clear to
creamy white as they age. They are laid singly into leaf tissue just below the epidermis.
The larvae appear as small maggots within the leaf, starting at about 1.0 mm in length
and reaching a length of about 1.9 mm. The pupa is initially golden brown and turns
darker. Life cycle: Leafminers have a short life cycle, completing a generation in 21 to 28
days in a favorable climate. Eggs are placed into leaf tissue and hatch in about 3 days.
Larvae feed and grow between the upper and lower surface of the leaf and develop
through three instars in about 4.6 days. As the larvae grow, the ‘tunnels’ created by their
feeding increase in diameter, creating the characteristic winding mines in the leaf. Larvae
emerge from the leaf and fall to the ground to pupate. The pupal stage lasts about 9 days.
The adult has a preoviposition period of about 1 day. Adult longevity is about 2 weeks,
with estimated oviposition of 35 to 39 eggs per day on a favorable host. Females make
 24
numerous punctures of the leaf with their ovipositor and use these sites for both feeding
and oviposition, with 10 to 25 percent of punctures used for oviposition dependent on
host quality.
Distribution, damage, and importance: An occasional pest. With severe infestations,
heavy leaf loss may lead to sun scald of fruit. The numerous punctures caused by females
can result in a stippled appearance on foliage, but is of little consequence at low levels.
The primary damage is the mining of leaves by larvae. Mining results in destruction of
leaf mesophyll. Mining can greatly depress photosynthesis but generally does not lead to
direct yield loss as most fruiting vegetables can withstand considerable leaf damage.
Extensive mining can result in premature leaf drop, leading to lack of shading and sun
scalding of fruit.
Chronology: Leafminers are generally considered secondary pests. Natural enemies
generally maintain populations at non-damaging levels, but populations can increase
rapidly following multiple insecticide applications.
Control measures used and recommended: Leafminer densities can be monitored in a
variety of ways including counting mines in leaves, counting live larvae in mines, sticky
traps for adults, or pan traps to catch larvae as they fall to the ground to pupate. Counting
mines in leaves may overestimate leafminer activity as many mines may be empty, but
this is the easiest and probably most frequently used method for monitoring. Insecticidal
control of leafminers is difficult because of the protected environment of the larvae and
severe insecticide resistance. Use of broad spectrum insecticides against other pests
frequently contributes to leafminer problems through disruption of natural biological
control.
Cultural/mechanical: None used commercially.
Biological: Several parasites attack this pest and can keep leafminer populations under
control. Leafminers rarely pose a serious threat to tomato production in Georgia except in
fields where their natural enemies are reduced by early, repeated insecticide applications.
Chemical: Begin treatments for leafminer control when populations reach an average of
fivemines/leaf with at least 25 percent of the mines containing live larvae.
Chemicals used:
• Abamectin (Agri-Mek) 0.15EC
• Cyromazine (Trigard) 75WP
• Spinosad (SpinTor) 2SC
Critical Issues: None identified at the present time.

Pest Name: Tomato fruitworm (Corn earworm)
(Order: Lepidoptera, Family: Noctuidae, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie))
Among the most serious pests of tomato is the tomato fruitworm or corn earworm,
particularly in the summer and fall. Several generations of tomato fruitworm may
develop each year. Adult: Adults are medium sized moths with wingspans of 32-45 mm.
Adults are variable in color, but the front wings are usually yellowish-brown and bear a
small dark spot near the center. The forewings usually have a darker band near the end of
the wings, but the margin of the wing is not darkened. The hind wings are creamy white
with a broad dark band near the wing margins, but the margin of the hind wing is creamy
white. Immature stages: Eggs are pale green when first deposited, turn yellowish and
then darken with age. Eggs are shaped like a somewhat flattened sphere with ridges (>
20) radiating from the top-center. Eggs are laid singly on the terminals or close to flowers
or small fruit. The eggs hatch in 3 to 5 days and the larvae can attack buds and fruit
shortly after hatching. The larvae vary greatly in color from a light green to brown or
nearly black and are lighter on the underside. They are marked with alternating light and
dark stripes running lengthwise on the body. Early instar larvae have stout hairs which
gives them a somewhat spiny appearance as compared to the smooth skin of most other
caterpillars found on tomatoes. Larvae range in size from 1.5 mm at hatching to 25mm at
maturity. The head tends to be orange or light brown with a white net-like markings and
the thoracic plate is black. Larval body color may be brown, green, pink or sometimes
yellow or near black. The larva usually has a broad dark lateral line above the spiracles
and a light line below the spiracles. Two dark lines may also occur along the center of the
back. A key characteristic that will separate corn earworm larvae from most other species
encountered in vegetables is the presence of black microscopic spines on the cuticle. The
pupal stage occurs in the soil. Pupae are 17-22 mm in length and mahogany-brown. Life
cycle: Eggs are deposited individually on leaf tissue and corn silks and hatch in 3-4 days.
Females can lay about 35 eggs per day with 500 - 3000 over their lifetime. Larvae can
feed and develop on foliage but preferentially feed on fruiting structures. Older larvae are
aggressive and cannibalistic, thus, individual fruit usually produce a single larvae. Larvae
usually develop through 5 or 6 instars in 14 to 21 days in field conditions. Larvae fall to
the ground and burrow into the soil to pupate. The pupal stage last about 13 days in the
summer and serves as the overwintering stage in the late fall.
Distribution, damage, and importance: This pest is very common in the coastal plain
region. Corn earworm damage is caused only by the larvae. Larvae have chewing
mouthparts and remove plant tissue. Although larvae can feed and develop on leaf tissue,
the preferred feeding sites in most crops are reproductive structures, such as corn ears and
tomato and tomato fruit. Early instar larvae will attack fruit without any leaf feeding. In
corn, a single larva generally develops on a single ear of corn. In fruiting vegetables, a
single larva frequently damages more than one fruit.
Chronology: Corn earworm can attack vegetable crops throughout most of the
production season, but early planted spring crops avoid heavy pest pressure. Late spring
crops and fall crops of favored hosts can experience greater fruit damage.
 26
Control measures used and recommended: Treatment is usually with insecticides and
only when the pest is present, so detection is important. Adults can be monitored with
pheromone or blacklight traps to estimate when moths are active. This can provide a
measure of relative densities or peak activity. In sweet corn, corn earworm is generally
controlled with scheduled applications of insecticides (frequently daily) during the silking
period. Eggs are frequently deposited on the silks and hatching larvae will immediately
feed on silks. Once the larvae enter the silk channel of the ear, they are protected from
insecticides. While applications every two days can provide protection equal to daily
applications, under heavy pest pressure any disruption of this schedule can result in
significant damage. In fruiting vegetables, larvae generally remain partially exposed or
move from fruit to fruit providing exposure, and better control can be obtained with
insecticides. Thus, scouting for eggs, larvae, and damage, and treating with insecticides
as needed is generally practiced. Although thresholds used are frequently
presence/absence, generally treatments for tomato fruitworm control should be applied
when one percent of fruit are infested with larvae or if eggs are easily found.
Cultural/mechanical: Generally not used commercially.
Biological: Bacillus thuringiensis is effective against earworm and preserve beneficial
predators such as the spined soldier bug and parasitoids like braconid wasps or
Trichogramma egg parasitoids.
Chemical: There have been recent concerns about insecticide resistance in corn earworm
populations in the Southeast. The older chemistries are more likely to experience
resistance problems.

Pest Name: Flea beetles (Order: Coleoptera, Family: Chrysomelidae/Alticinae)
Tobacco (Epitrix hirtipennis (Melsheimer))
Southern tobacco (Epitrix fasciata (Blatchley))
Pale striped (Systena blanda (Melsheimer))
The name flea beetle applies to a variety of small beetles, with enlarged hind legs, which
jump vigorously when disturbed. Their injury consists of small, rounded or irregular
holes eaten through or into the leaf. The most common flea beetles are about 1/16 inch
long and nearly a uniform black in color. Flea beetles may attack tomatoes at any time
during the growing season but are often most numerous and of greatest concern early in
the season. Insecticides for control of flea beetles should be applied when flea beetles
become numerous and defoliation is greater than 10 percent. Flea beetles generally do not
require control once plants are beyond the 5 leaf stage. Adult: The tobacco and southern
tobacco adults are small (1.4-2.2 mm in length) and reddish, yellow brown, with a brown
patch across the width of the elytra. The southern tobacco adult is slightly smaller and
wider than the tobacco flea beetle. The pale striped flea beetle adult is larger (3.0-4.3 mm
long) and has a pair of pale yellow stripes lengthwise down the back, one stripe on each
elytron. Immature stages: All of the above species have three larval instars that are
whitish with darker heads, and all feed on fine roots near the soil surface or occasionally
tunnel into larger roots. The tobacco flea beetles range from 1 mm after hatching to 4.2
mm at maturity, while the pale stripe larvae range from 1 to 11 mm. Life cycle: Tobacco
flea beetle females can lay up to 200 eggs which hatch in 6-8 days. The larval
development typically last from 16-20 days under warm conditions. The last instar larva
forms a small cell in the soil where it pupates, and the adult emerges 4-5 days later for a
total of 26-33 days. The pale striped flea beetle requires a longer time to develop from
egg to adult, 28-54 days total.
Distribution, damage, and importance: Not a widespread problem. Typical flea beetle
damage occur in the foliage of young crop plants, and damage usually manifests itself as
numerous small shot holes through the leaves. This occurs early in the growing season
and can show up soon after transplanting depending on the date.
Chronology: There are 3-4 generations of the tobacco flea beetles per year. High number
have been observed in south Georgia in late
 28
June in Solanceous crop transplants, and we think that this is likely a second generation.
Up to two generations of pale striped flea beetle have been reported per year.
Control measures used and recommended: Significant yield loss has been reported for
levels of flea beetles at five adults per plant very early in the growing season. We suspect
that 5-10% defoliation is sufficient reason for controlling this foliar feeder early in the
growing season. Late season control is seldom if ever warranted.
Cultural/mechanical: Flea beetles may carry over from previous crops.
Biological: Natural enemies of the tobacco flea beetle adults include the bigeyed bug,
Geocoris punctipes.
Chemicals: Only use insecticides if damage reaches 10% defoliation and usually a single
application will suffice.

True Bugs Group
Pest Name: Stink bugs (Order: Heteroptera, Family: Pentatomidae)
Southern green stink bug (Nezara viridula (Linnaeus))
Green stink bug (Acrosternum hilare (Say))
Brown stink bug (Euschistus servus (Say))
Adult: Stink bugs are generally medium sized shield-shaped insects with broad
‘shoulders’, relatively straight sided, bluntly rounded abdomen. Stink bugs possess a
dorsal, triangular shaped, shield on their backs. All stink bugs have piercing-sucking
mouthparts. Probably the most common stink bug in vegetables in Georgia is the
Southern Green Sting Bug. Adults are a uniform dull light green, thought the ventral
 29
surface is paler. They are 13-17 mm long and about 8 mm wide. The green stink bug
appears similar to the southern green but has a pointed spine between the last two legs. In
the southern green stink bug, this spine is rounded. The brown stink bug and related
species appear similar in shape to the southern green stink bug but are various shades of
brown on the upper surface and tan to yellow on the lower surface.
Immature stages: Stink bug eggs are somewhat barrel-shaped and are deposited on end in
closely packed clusters. Egg coloration, cluster size and arrangement of eggs within the
cluster vary with species. The southern green sting bug lays cluster of 30-130 eggs.
Clusters are deposited in hexagonal clusters with the eggs arranged in straight rows and
glued together. Eggs are about 1.3 mm long, yellowish-white to pinkish-yellow, and the
top of the egg is clearly indicated by a ring of tiny spines. Eggs darken near hatching. The
southern green stink bug has five nymphal instars. Nymphs are shaped similar to the
adults but lack wings. Wing pads are apparent and grow longer with each instar. Color
varies with instar. First instar nymphs are yellowish-orange to brown. Second and third
instar nymphs have a black head and throax and a reddish-black abdomen. Both the
thorax and abdomen are marked with yellowish spots. The forth instar nymph may appear
similar to the second and third instar or may be greenish with the thorax light green with
black markings and the abdomen dark green with salmon shading and white markings.
Coloration of the fifth instar is also variable. The head, thorax and wing pads range from
light green to almost black. The abdomen is colored similar to the thorax and marked
with rose and white spots. (Southern green stink bug) Life cycle: Eggs clusters are
generally laid on the underside of leaves and hatch in about 5 days. Typically all eggs in a
cluster will hatch within 1-1.5 hours. The southern green stink bug develops through five
instars in about 32 days. Females begin oviposition about 14-20 days after attaining the
adult stage.
Distribution, damage, and importance: Several species of stink bugs can damage
tomatoes. Stink bugs have piercing-sucking mouthparts with which they puncture plant
tissue and remove sap. The greatest damage results from feeding on fruiting structures.
As it heals, the feeding site becomes hard and darkens. Seeds fed upon may be shriveled,
deformed and shrunken, or may simply bear a dark spot and depression at the feeding
site, depending on the stage of development when attacked. Similarly, damage to ears of
corn and fruit varies greatly with the development stage at which the produce is fed upon.
Damage early in development can lead to severe deformities and abscission while
damage near harvest may result in small dark spots at the feeding site. Stink bugs can
also introduce bacteria and yeast, or simply provide a site of entry for disease organisms,
as they feed, resulting in fruit decay.
Chronology: Stink bugs are rarely of concern in flower vegetables prior to flowering.
Although they can feed in leaves and stems, reproductive structures, such as corn ears,
tomato and tomato fruit, seeds, and pods are preferred feeding sites. Populations can
build rapidly once flowering is initiated.
Control measures used and recommended: Stink bugs are typically controlled with
insecticides used throughout the fruit production period of susceptible crops.
Identification of stink bug species involved prior to selection of insecticide is important
 30
as different species respond differently to insecticides and there are predatory species of
stink bugs found in vegetables. Although sweep net sampling is an effective means of
sampling stink bugs in beans and similar crops, in most vegetable crops sampling is
conducted with visual examination of plants and fruiting structures.
Cultural/mechanical: Proximity to other host crops, such as cotton, can increase
numbers.
Biological: Biological control of the southern green stink bug is provided by parasites,
usually wasps and flies. In Florida a tachinid fly, Trichopoda pennipes, parasitizes adults
and nymphs, and a wasp, Trissolcus basalis, parasitizes eggs. These two parasites have
been introduced as biological control agents in places such as Australia and Hawaii to
control the southern green stink bug. Recently California used T. basalis in an effort to
control its southern green stink bug population.
Chemical: Stink bugs are typically controlled with insecticides particularly throughout
the fruit production period when the tomato fruit are the most susceptible.
Chemicals used:

**************************
Pest Name: Leaffooted bugs
(Order: Heteroptera, Family: Coreidae, Leptoglossus spp.)
Leaffooted bugs are brown, medium sized bugs which get their common name from the
flattened leg segment of the hind leg, which gives this segment a leaf-like appearance.
There are seven recorded species in the southeastern United States with Leptoglossus
phyllopus being very common. They are medium sized bugs, usually about 20 mm long.
 31
Adults are brown. Some species have a broad white strip across the body about midway
between the head and tip of the abdomen. Most also have white markings on the leaf-like
section of the hind leg. Immature stages: Eggs are about 1.4 mm long, barrel shaped,
bronze to dark brown, and deposited in rows. Nymphs are orange, red, or reddish-brown
and similar to adults in shape but lack wings. Life cycle: Eggs are deposited in rows on
foliage or stem tissue and hatch in 5-7 days. Nymphs develop through 5 instars in 25-30
days. Typically only one generation has been observed per year in Georgia, with the long
lived adults serving as the overwintering stage.
Distribution, damage, and importance: Can be an important pest of organic tomato
production systems, but less common in commercial tomato. Leaffooted bugs have
piercing-sucking mouthparts and damage crops similarly to stinkbugs. The greatest
damage results from feeding on fruiting structures. As it heals, the feeding site becomes
hard and darkens. Seeds fed upon may be shriveled, deformed, and shrunken, or may
simply bear a dark spot and depression at the feeding site, depending on the stage of
development when attacked. Similarly, damage to ears of corn and fruit varies greatly
with the development stage at which the produce is fed upon. Damage early in
development can lead to severe deformities and abscission, while damage near harvest
may result in small dark spots at the feeding site.
Chronology: Adults emerge from overwintering under plant trash or mulch in late
spring. Some species reproduce only on weeds while others will reproduce on vegetables.
As fruit damage is the primary concern, movement into fields after flowering is the time
of greatest concern.
Control measures used and recommended: Leaffooted bugs appear to be developing
into a more consistent pest in Georgia, particularly on organic forms where they can
readily overwinter under organic mulches, but are still considered as sporadic pests.
Visual plant examination for all stages is the most common sampling method. Some
species of leaffooted bug reproduce only on thistle, and weed management may reduce
damage potential. When populations move into susceptible crops, they are generally
controlled with insecticides.
Cultural/mechanical: A simple solution is to remove overwintering sites, such as
organic mulches, but in organic production systems, water can drive bugs out of the
mulch where they can be collected or destroyed mechanically.
Biological: Egg parasites, Gryon spp., often keep populations of leaffooted bug below
economically damaging levels.
Chemical: Insecticides used for stinkbug control generally control this pest.
Chemicals used:
• Bifenthrin (Capture) 2EC

**************************
Pest Name: Hornworms (Order: Lepidoptera, Family: Sphingidae)
Tomato hornworm (Manduca quinquemaculata (Haworth))
Tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta (Linnaeus))
Hornworms are large, green, caterpillars with white diagonal markings. They reach a
length of 3 inches. The most distinguishing characteristic of hornworms is the slender
horn projecting backward from the rear of the body. Hornworms may feed on green fruit,
but primarily feed on the foliage of tomato plants and may cause enough defoliation to
allow sun scald of fruit. The adult moths deposit spherical translucent eggs, singly on the
undersides of leaves. Treatments for hornworm control should be applied when one larva
is found on 4 percent of the plants examined. Adult: These two species are similar in
appearance. Both are large moths with a wingspan of 80 to 130 mm. The front wings are
larger and much longer than the hind wings. Both species are grayish-brown or dull-gray
moths with the abdomen marked by a series of orange-yellow spots down each side (six
paired spots on the tobacco hornworm and 5 paired spots on the tomato hornworm). The
abdomen tapers to a point. Immature stages: Eggs are spherical to oval and 1.25 to 1.5
mm in diameter. They are light green or yellow when laid and turn white at maturity. The
larva is cylindrical, with 5 pair of prolegs (4 abdominal plus anal prolegs) and three pair
of thoracic legs. Young larvae are yellowish-white but turn green with white diagonal
markings on each side of abdominal segments. The most striking characteristic of these
larvae is the presence of a thick pointed structure or ‘horn’ projecting backward from the
top of the last abdominal segment. Last instar larvae are large, averaging about 8 cm in
length. The large brown to reddish-brown pupae (45-60 mm long) possess a pronounced
maxillary loop, which looks similar to a flattened handle on a teacup. Life cycle: There
are likely 2 to 4 generations of these pests in Georgia. Both species overwinter in the
 33
pupal stage. Females are reported to lay 250 to 350 eggs but can produce nearly 1400
eggs under favorable conditions. Eggs are laid singularly on foliage and hatch in about 5
days. Larvae go through 5 or 6 instars, starting at about 6.7 mm and reaching a length of
about 8 cm. Larval development time averages about 20 days. The pupal stage occurs in
the soil at a depth of 10 to 15 cm. The pupal stage in the summer generations averages
about 51 days but can extend greater than 100 days.
Distribution, damage, and importance: Tobacco hornworm is an occasional pest in the
summer fall production season. While these pests can occur on all the fruiting vegetables,
they are common only on tomatoes. Although common, they generally are not of
economic concern except in home gardens. The larvae are defoliators, generally attacking
the upper portion of plants first. They generally consume entire leaves rather than
chewing holes in leaves. About 90% of the foliage consumption occurs in the last instar.
The color of the larvae makes them difficult to detect as they blend with the foliage. They
are frequently not detected until they consume considerable foliage at the end of their
development.
Chronology: There are 3-4 generations per year in northern Florida. Damage is much
more severe in the fall production season.
Control measures used and recommended: Insecticides are the main tactic for control.
While individual larvae can consume considerable foliage, populations of these pests
seldom reach a level that justifies corrective action in commercial production
Cultural/mechanical: On one occasion, the use of metallic silver mulch was observed to
result in more Lepidoptera pests. In home gardens, where individual plants are more
valuable, hand picking usually provides adequate control.
Biological: Bacillus thuringiensis is effective against hornworm and preserve beneficial
predators such as the spined soldier bug and parasitoids like braconid wasps or
Trichogramma egg parasitoids.
Chemical: Insecticides used for armyworms generally control this pest.

**************************
Pest Name: Aphids (Order: Homoptera, Family: Aphididae)
Potato (Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas))
Green peach (Myzus persicae (Sulzer))
Aphids or plant lice are small, soft-bodied insects that may feed on tomato plants from
time of planting until last harvest. Aphids cluster in shaded places on leaves, stems and
blossoms. While winged migrants move from field to field spreading virus diseases such
as Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV), host plant resistance in tomato has helped minimize
this problem. CMV was a fairly widespread problem in the fall of 2006. Large
populations of aphids on young plants can cause wilting and stunting but rarely occur. At
harvest, infestations can become contaminations both through their presence and through
production of honeydew which gives rise to sooty mold. Establishment of aphid colonies
on tomato is often reduced by wet weather, but during cool, dry weather, large numbers
of aphids may develop quickly. Aphid feeding causes newly formed leaves to be crinkled
and malformed. While several species of aphids can occur on fruiting vegetables, the
most frequent species of concern on these crops is the green peach aphid, and potato
aphids can occur first in the spring in southern Georgia. Adult: Greenpeach aphid:
Winged (alate) adults have a black head and thorax and a yellowish-green abdomen with
a large dark patch in the middle of the abdomen as viewed from above. They measure
about 2 mm in length. A key characteristic that separates GPA from other species of
aphids found on vegetables are rounded projections at the base of the antennae (tubercles)
that point toward the midline of the head. These projections are found on all stages.
Wingless adults are yellowish, greenish, or reddish. The cornicles are long and colored
similar to the body. Potato aphid: The adults vary in appearance occurring in a green or
pink form. The wingless adult is 3-4 mm long, and the typical form in Georgia in the
 35
spring is the pink form. The base of the antennae is smooth unlike the green peach aphid.
Immature stages: Nymphs are very similar to wingless adults in shape and color but are
smaller. Unlike most aphids, green peach aphids do not tend to form large colonies, but
will generally be more evenly distributed across leaves. The pink form of the potato
aphid is common in the spring in Georgia. Life cycle: In northern climates, the life cycle
of the GPA is very complex with winter hosts and summer hosts. In vegetable crops in
Georgia, winged adults invade fields and can do so throughout the production seasons.
Both winged and wingless adults give birth to live young without mating (parthenogentic
reproduction) on vegetable crops. Under favorable conditions, the aphids develop through
4 or 5 instars in about 1 week and give birth to offspring shortly thereafter, with
generation time as short as 10 to 12 days. Females are reported to produce 1.6 to 3.75
nymphs per day over a 15 to 20 day reproductive cycle. The potato aphid life cycle is
similar.
Distribution, damage, and importance: Aphid transmitted CMV was a fairly
widespread problem in the fall of 2006 in South Georgia and aphids are common
throughout the Southeast. Green peach aphids can build large populations on a variety of
crops. On young plants they can cause wilting and stunting. At harvest they can represent
a contaminant both through their direct presence and through production of honeydew
which gives rise to sooty mold. In many crops, their greatest threat is transmission of
viral diseases. This species transmits over 100 plant viruses, with both persistent and nonpersistent transmission. Both adults and nymphs can transmit viruses, but winged adults
are of greatest importance because of their mobility
Chronology: Green peach aphid can invade fruiting vegetables throughout the spring and
fall production season, but typically are more of a problem in cooler parts of the fall
season. In the spring, potato aphids disperse off of winter crops such as kale and spinach
to solanaceous crops.
Control measures used and recommended: Green peach aphids are generally
controlled with application of insecticides; however, insecticide resistance has been
widely documented in this species. The red phase of this pest is reported to generally be
more difficult to control. Potato aphids are often controlled by the natural occurrence of
predators such as Coccinellid larvae. Aphid populations can be assessed by examining
terminals and the undersides of leaves. Treatments for aphids in early spring plantings
may be postponed until distinct colonies of immature aphids are found on greater than 10
percent of the plants. Aphids in late summer plantings are usually controlled by
treatments for whiteflies; however in 2006, we experienced a high incidence of CMV
even with controls such as Admire, so we have a recent, unresolved problem.
Cultural/mechanical: Use CMV resistant cultivars if available.
Biological: Many beneficials attack aphids, but in the case of virus transmission, this
may not help the initial infection.
 36
Chemical: Labeled insecticides are given below, but there can be varying degrees of
efficacy and label restrictions. For preventative control, the neonicotinoids are usually
applied at transplanting.

State/local pesticide restrictions or limitations, export issues, etc.: A lot older
chemistries tend to select for resistance quickly or may be losing registration.
Critical Issues: Determine the cause of this new aphid-transmitted CMV outbreak.
Research
1) We thought whiteflies might be involved somehow in the CMV outbreak this last
fall, but the initial attempt to transmit CMV with whiteflies was unsuccessful, so
we need to clearly determine the species and role of aphids or other possible
vectors involved in the CMV outbreaks
2) Aphid vector biology and management studies are needed to address mosaic virus
problems affecting vegetables in the Southeaster USA
Regulatory
1) Older insecticide chemistries may be losing registration which could be a problem
for rotations used for resistance management
Education
1) Need general information disseminated to growers on aphid-transmitted viruses
and their management
**************************
European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner)) The moths are fairly small, with
males having a wingspan of 20-26 mm and females 25-34 mm. Adults caught in south
Georgia are generally smaller than the ‘typical’ European Corn Borer from the mid-west
 37
corn belt. Females are pale-yellow to light brown, with darker zig-zag lines across the
forewing and hind wing. Males are darker, usually pale brown, with dark zig-zag lines
across the forewing and hind wing. Both sexes also have yellowish to gold colored
patches on the wings which are more apparent against the darker background in the male.
Eggs are oval, flattened and creamy white when first laid and darken with age. They are
deposited in small clusters with the eggs overlapped like fish scales. Larvae tend to be
light brown or pinkish-gray, with a brown to black head capsule. Full grown larvae are
about 2 cm in length. The body is marked with darker circles on each segment along the
midline of the back. Larvae are frequently referred to as having a ‘greasy’ look. Larvae
can be easily confused with other borers present in plant stalks. Life cycle: Eggs are
generally deposited in irregular clusters of about 15 to 20 on the underside of leaves and
hatch in 4 to 9 days depending on the temperature. Larvae usually develop through 5 or 6
instars with a development period of over 30 days and a pupal stage of about 12 days.
There are probably 3 or 4 generations in Georgia. European corn borer is considered to be
the most important sweet corn pest in northern production regions. In Georgia, this pest is
usually controlled by insecticide applications targeted at corn earworm.
Distribution, damage, and importance: In Georgia, the level of damage from ECB in
pepper is usually minimal, but the presence of this pest in these crops restricts shipment
to some states. ECB can attack all above ground parts of a corn plant including the
leaves, stalk, tassels, silk, kernels, and cob. Older larvae tend to bore into the stalk, base
of the ear, cob, or kernels. Larvae damage both the stem and fruit of beans and pepper.
Trapping and treatment programs allow for shipment of these crops to California and
Texas. For regulations associated with shipment of these crops to California or Texas,
contact the Georgia Department of Agriculture. GDA currently maintains a monitoring
program.
Chronology: European corn borer overwinter in the larval stage, with pupation and
emergence of adults in early spring. Populations in Georgia generally do not reach very
high levels, but are of concern in sweet corn, peppers and snap beans because of shipping
restrictions associated with the presence of this pest. Where present, corn borer can attack
vegetable crops throughout most of the production season, but early planted spring crops
avoid pest pressure. Late spring crops and fall crops of favored hosts likely have more
pressure.
Control measures used and recommended: In Georgia, European corn borer is
generally controlled by insecticide applications targeting other pests. The regulatory
programs for sweet corn, pepper, and snap bean require monitoring of ECB with
pheromone traps, insecticide applications, and phyto-sanitary certificates depending on
the crop involved and the state to which the produce will be shipped. For regulations
associated with shipment of these crops to California or Texas, contact the Georgia
Department of Agriculture.
Cultural/mechanical: Monitoring and sanitation can be used.
 38
Biological: Bacillus thuringiensis is effective against corn borer and preserve beneficial
predators such as the spined soldier bug and parasitoids like braconid wasps or
Trichogramma egg parasitoids.
Chemical: This pest is usually controlled when other Lepidoptera pests are being treated.
Control is mainly used to address the quarantine problem for peppers grown in Georgia
that are bound for the west coast.

Pest Name: Tobacco budworm
(Order: Lepidoptera, Family: Noctuidae, Heliothis virescens (Fabricius))
Adult: Adults are medium sized moths with wingspans of 28-35 mm. Adults are variable
in color, but the front wings are usually yellowish-brown and are crossed transversely by
three dark bands. The hind wings are creamy white with a broad dark band near the wing
margins, but the margin of the hind wing is creamy white. Immature stages: Eggs are
pale green when first deposited, turn yellowish, and then darken with age. Eggs are
shaped like a somewhat flattened sphere with ridges (18-25) radiating from the topcenter. Larvae range in size from 1.5 mm at hatching to 25-36 mm at maturity. The head
tends to be yellowish-brown, and the body color may be brown, green, pink, or
sometimes yellow or maroon. The larvae closely resemble corn earworm larvae. A key
characteristic that will separate corn earworm larvae from most other species encountered
in vegetables is the presence of black microscopic spines on the cuticle. The pupal stage
occurs in the soil. Pupae are 18 mm in length and mahogany-brown. Life cycle: Eggs are
deposited individually on leaf tissue and hatch in 3-4 days. Females can lay about 300-
500 eggs with as many as 1500 over their lifetime. Larvae can feed and develop on
foliage but preferentially feed on buds. Larvae usually develop through 5-7 instars in 17-
18 days at 25° C. Larvae fall to the ground and borrow into the soil to pupate. The pupal
 39
stage last about 13 days in the summer and serves as the overwintering stage in the late
fall.
Distribution, damage, and importance: Tobacco budworm is an occasional pest whose
damage is caused only by the larvae. Larvae have chewing mouthparts and remove plant
tissue. Although larvae can feed and develop on leaf tissue, the preferred feeding site in
most crops is the buds in fruiting structures.
Chronology: Tobacco budworm can attack vegetable crops throughout most of the
production season, but it has rarely been a problem in tomato.
Control measures used and recommended: Although this pest is significant in tobacco,
it is rarely a problem in tomato. Adults can be monitored with pheromone or blacklight
traps to estimate when moths invade or emerge, and relative densities or peak activity. In
fruiting vegetables, larvae generally remain partially exposed or move from bud to bud
providing exposure and better control can be obtained with insecticides. This pest is
usually controlled when other Lepidoptera pests are being treated.
Cultural/mechanical: No specific methods used.
Biological: Bacillus thuringiensis is effective against budworm and preserve beneficial
predators such as the spined soldier bug and parasitoids like braconid wasps or
Trichogramma egg parasitoids.
Chemical: This pest is usually controlled when other Lepidoptera pests are being treated.

**************************
Tarnished Plant Bugs and Lygus Bugs. Tarnished plant and related bugs are sucking
insects that primarily attack the young flower buds causing them to abort. Young flower
buds turn yellow to black after tarnished plant bug feeding. Infestations may be heavy in
spring plantings and fruit set can be poor if the bugs are not controlled. Both nymphs and
adults feed on tomato. The nymphs are difficult to find unless high numbers are present.
Scouting for the adults is relatively simple. Visually examine plants and treat if one adult
per six plants is found.
Control measures used and recommended: Control has traditionally been limited to
insecticides and only when noticeable damage is occurring in the field. Bugs are
generally controlled when sprays for other insect pests are made.

Pest Name: Wireworms (Order: Coleoptera, Family: Elateridae)
Southern potato (Conoderus falli (Lane))
Tobacco (Conoderus vespertinus (Fabricius))
Gulf (Conoderus amplicollis (Gyllenhal))

Description:
Adult: Adult click beetles are long, dark brown, and measure 6 to 10 mm long. The
elytra, or wing covers, are striated with parallel small channels. When flipped on their
back, the beetles will snap their head and abdomen in order to flip themselves over,
making a click sound, hence the name click beetle. Immature stages: The larvae are
called wireworms and are initially light colored but turn creamy to dark yellow with the
head and pronotum becoming reddish orange. Mature larvae are about 17 mm long and 2
mm wide. Life cycle: The immature stages of wireworms occur in the soil and typically
 41
feed on plant roots. The number of instars is 3-4, and development time in the spring and
summer is 40-70 days, but the overwintering larvae can take 200 days to develop. The
pupal stage occurs in the upper 10 cm of the soil.
Distribution, damage, and importance: Not a widespread problem. Wireworms feed on
seeds, roots, stems, and tubers of many vegetable crops. In tomato and other solanaceous
crops the main damage caused is crop stand loss. This typically occurs in non-fumigated
production systems, such as organic production, and is generally not a problem in plastic
culture production.
Chronology: There is one generation per year of the above species. Oviposition by adults
occurs mainly March through September.
Control measures used and recommended: Grass cover crops, such as sorghum, are
highly attractive to wireworms. Thus, it is not recommended to follow solanaceous crops
after grass crops or fallow land without proper treatment to remove wireworms from the
soil. Since there is only a single generation per year, soil treatment prior to the growing
season can be very effective. In organic situations, flooding of fields for six weeks can
remove wireworm infestations. Rotating with legume crops, which are not attractive to
wireworms, can also help. Occasionally, baiting with whole corn, potato, carrots, or other
attractive food buried in the top 10-15 cm of the soil can be useful in detecting a
wireworm infestation.
Cultural/mechanical: Wireworms are associated with weeds and also tend to be greater
following grass production in the field recently prepared for tomato.
Biological: None currently used in commercial tomato.
Chemicals used: Fumigation under plastic mulch beds eliminates this problem
State/local pesticide restrictions or limitations, export issues, etc.: Loss of methyl
bromide
Critical Issues: None identified at the present time
**************************
Pest Name: Cutworms (Order: Lepidoptera, Family: Noctuidae)
Black (Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel))
Granulate (Agrotis subterranea (Fabricius))
Adult: The moths of both cutworm species described here are fairly large, the black has a
40-55 mm wingspan and the granulate has a 31-43 mm wingspan. The forewing of the
black is dark brown throughout, and that of the granulate cutworm is gray to light brown
with a distinct double spot (one small round the other bean-shaped) located centrally.
Immature stages: Both species have small (<1mm in length) white eggs that are
oviposited on the plant foliage. The granuate cutworm oviposites either singly or in small
 42
clusters. The black cutworm lays eggs in clusters. There are usually six larval instars for
each species, but this can vary from 5 to 9. Both have dark brown pupae that occur 3-12
cm below the soil surface.
Life cycle: The development from egg to adult is 35-66 days for black and 35-57 days for
granulate cutworm. The duration of the larval (feeding) stages is 20-40 days for black
and 22-32 days for granulate cutworm, so if detected in the field at planting, they can
cause damage for the entire seedling stage of the crop.
Distribution, damage, and importance: Not a widespread problem. These cutworms,
like their name indicates, cut the seedling plant off at the soil surface. This early season
damage is the most important, because it causes direct stand loss and often results in
reseeding or resetting transplants.
Chronology: Both cutworm species likely have four generations per year in Georgia, and
moths are present from when they emerge from overwintering in March to October
(overlapping generations).
Control measures used and recommended: If the season that one is planting in
coincides with cutworm activity annually, then preventative or curative actions can be
taken. Monitoring for adult flights can be done with pheromone traps in the spring and
light traps in the summer and fall.
Cultural/mechanical: Cutworms are associated with weeds and also tend to be greater in
wet spots in the field.
Biological: There are some natural enemies of cutworm, but they often need to be
augmented and kept in moist conditions to be effective, such as the addition of
entomopathogenic nematodes.
Chemical: Baits, insecticide treated bran-molasses mixtures are very effective when
broadcast over the soil surface at the time of seeding or transplant. Sprays of soil
treatments are also used at the first sign of cutworm activity.
Chemicals used:
• Bifenthrin (Capture) 2EC

Diseases and Nematodes General Overview
David B. Langston, Jr.
Department of Plant Pathology
University of Georgia
The diseases that affect tomato include the following. Nematodes are small, slender,
microscopic round worms which live in the soil. The root-knot nematode is the most
common type affecting tomato in Georgia. If not managed, this pest can cause serious
damage in light, sandy-textured soils. Three species of Root-Knot nematode
(Meloidogyne incognita, M. hapla, M. arenaria) are the most damaging on tomato in
Georgia. There are some soilborne diseases that affect tomatoes. These diseases can
attack the crop from seedling stage through harvest and are referred to as crown-rot
diseases. Many of these diseases, however, attack the foliage and fruit and are deposited
there by water splash or by physical contact between the fruit and the soil. There are
several foliar diseases of tomato, such as anthracnose and bacterial spot, which can cause
losses each year. Some of these diseases are soilborne, some are seedborne, and some are
carried to fields on air currents. Finally, there are virus induced diseases that have been a
severe limiting factor in tomato production in Georgia for several years. Most virus
diseases cause stunting, leaf distortion, mosaic leaf discoloration, and spots or
discoloration on fruit. The distribution of virus-infected plants is usually random with
symptomatic plants often bordered on either side by healthy, non-symptomatic plants.
Virus diseases are almost always transmitted by insect vectors and the severity of a virus
disease is usually tied to the rise and fall in the populations of these vectors from season
to season and within a given season. However, some virus diseases are seed and
mechanically transmitted. Only the viruses that have been the most problematic on
tomato in Georgia will be covered in this section. These include Cucumber mosaic virus,
Tobacco mosaic virus, Tobacco etch virus, Potato y virus, and Tomato spotted wilt virus.
 44
Tomato Disease Management Research, Regulatory and Education Priorities
Research
1) Phytophthera management tactics need to be developed and validated for efficacy
in commercial tomato production systems.
2) Effect of methyl bromide alternatives on soil-borne diseases—rhizoctonia,
phytopthora, nematodes, pythium need investigation.
3) Host plant resistance needs to be further developed—TSWV, bacterial spot;
including relationship of TSWV to fruit quality and irregular ripening
4) Seed-borne disease—bacterial spot, viruses need investigation.
5) Annual evaluations of efficacy continue to be critical.
6) Disease agent/insect vector interactions need much more study.
7) Application of chemicals using drip irrigation/chemigation needs refinement.
Regulatory
1) Monitoring by the departments of agriculture of diseases that could affect
shipment of live materials into and out of the State should be increased.
2) Database for registered pesticides by state and commodity are needed.
3) Consequences of labeling changes of copper (bacterial spot) i.e. reduction in
number of applications needs to be looked at.
4) Maintaining multiple modes of action for resistance management is critical.
5) Science-based buffer restrictions are needed accounting for impact on agricultural
land usage.
6) Monitoring and regulation is needed of seed-borne diseases and transplants—
including importation from other countries.
Education
1) Current information on tomato disease best management practices for each State
needs to be centrally linked on a university maintained Tomato IPM website and
then linked between States.
2) Web-based or hard copy publications of pest identification are needed that are
user friendly.
3) Greater information and outreach is needed on post-harvest problems associated
with diseases and other pests.
4) Field visits and hands-on IPM training of governmental regulatory personnel
could result in better interaction regulators and end users.
5) Fact sheets for resistance management (mode of action) are needed.
6) Modeling of diseases (prediction), epidemiology of virus and vectors needs both
research and extension efforts.
7) Need more public awareness of impacts of use restrictions on products and crops.

Disease Pest-by-Pest General Profiles
FOLIAR DISEASES
There are several foliar diseases of tomato that can cause losses each year. Some of these
diseases are soilborne, some are seedborne, and some are carried to fields on air currents.
Bacterial Spot
Bacterial spot is the most common and often the most serious disease affecting tomatoes
in Georgia. This disease is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas axonopodis pv.
vesicatoria. Bacterial spot lesions can be observed on leaves stems and fruit and occurs
during all stages of plant growth. Leaf lesions usually begin as small water-soaked
lesions that gradually become necrotic and brown in the center. During wet periods the
lesions appear more water-soaked. Lesions generally appear sunken on the upper surface
and raised on the lower surface of infected leaves. During periods of favorable weather,
spots can coalesce and cause large areas of chlorosis. Premature leaf drop is the ultimate
result of leaf infection. Fruit lesions appear as small, round, dark brown to black spots.
 The bacterium is primarily seed-borne and most epidemics can be traced back,
directly or indirectly, to an infected seed source. Infected seedlings carry the disease to
the field where it spreads rapidly during warm, wet weather. Workers working in wet
fields can also be a major source of disease spread. All tomato seed planted for
transplants, or direct seeded field grown tomatoes should be tested by a reputable seed
testing company. Transplants should be inspected for bacterial spot lesions before being
sold or planted in the field.
 Prevention is the best method for suppressing losses to bacterial spot. Seed should be
purchased from companies that produce the seed in areas where the disease is not known
to occur. Hot water seed treatment can also be used and tomato seed can be soaked in
water that is 122 degrees F for 25 minutes to kill the bacterium. Transplant production
should take place in areas away from commercial production so as to avoid
contamination from production fields or vice versa.
 Unlike pepper, tomatoes have little to no commercially available cultivars resistant to
bacterial spot. Rotate away from fields where tomatoes have been grown within the last
year and use practices that destroy volunteer plants that could allow the disease to be
carried over to a subsequent crop. Cull piles should be located away from production
fields or transplant houses. Copper fungicides used in conjunction with maneb will
suppress disease losses if applied on a preventive schedule with a sprayer that gives
adequate coverage.
Anthracnose
There are really two anthracnose diseases of tomato caused by Colletotrichum acutaum
and gloeosporioides. Both of these fungi cause diseases primarily on fruit. C.
gloeosporioides causes disease on ripe fruit and C. acutatum causes disease on both
immature and ripe fruit. Lesions are usually round and sunken and can be over an inch in
diameter depending on the size of the fruit. Initially, lesions will contain a small area of
tan to pink sporulation near the center. In Georgia, C. acutatum has recently been
associated with the more serious outbreaks. Anthracnose can be introduced to a field
through contaminated seed or be sustained infested plant debris. This disease is favored
 47
warm, wet, humid weather. This disease controlled by using disease-free seed and
rotating away from fields with a known of losses to anthracnose. Preventive fungicide
applications are also recommended.
DISEASES CAUSED BY VIRUSES
Virus diseases have been a severe limiting factor in tomato production in Georgia for
several years. Most virus diseases cause stunting, leaf distortion, mosaic leaf
discoloration, and spots or discoloration on fruit. The distribution of virus-infected plants
is usually random with symptomatic plants often bordered on either side by healthy, nonsymptomatic plants. Virus diseases are almost always transmitted by insect vectors and
the severity of a virus disease is usually tied to the rise and fall in the populations of these
vectors from season to season and within a given season. However, some virus diseases
are seed and mechanically transmitted. Only the viruses that have been the most
problematic on tomato in Georgia will be covered in this section.
Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV)
TSWV is on the most common viruses affecting tomato in the southeastern U.S. This
virus is transmitted by thrips and can affect tomato at any stage of development. The
extensive host range of TSWV in weeds allows for a continual source of inoculum for
infection. However, as with any virus disease, early infections tend to cause more yield
losses than those occurring later in plant development. TSWV causes plant stunting,
ringspots, and bronzing on infected plants. Tomato fruit produced on infected plants may
be misshapen, have dark streaks, or have chlorotic spots. TSWV in Georgia tomato has
been suppressed through the use of black plastic and other colored mulches as well as
resistant varieties.
Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)
CMV is a very common disease of tomato and can be very devastating where it occurs.
This virus is transmitted by aphids and can be maintained in several weed species that
surround production fields. The characteristic symptom for CMV is severely stunted,
distorted, and strapped (faciated) leaves, stems, and petioles. Symptoms of CMV can
also cause an oak-leaf type pattern on leaves by causing necrosis and/or leaf discoloration
along leaf veins. Few options are available for suppressing losses to CMV, however,
destruction of weed hosts that harbor the virus will aid in suppressing disease spread.
Recommended practices in chronological order are as follows:
1. Rotation with non-solanaceous crops reduces potential inoculum from anthracnose.
2. Use bacterial spot resistant varieties if available.
3. Avoid stringing or staking tomatoes when field are wet.
4. Spray copper + maneb beginning at transplanting and carry through harvest for
bacterial spot.
5. Begin alternating in Quadris, Cabrio, or Tanos prior to fruit formation for anthracnose.
Note (be sure to follow label on high fungicide resistance risk products like these).
 48
SOILBORNE DISEASES
There are some soilborne diseases that affect tomatoes. These diseases can attack the
crop from seedling stage through harvest and are referred to as crown-rot diseases. Many
of these diseases, however, attack the foliage and fruit and are deposited there by water
splash or by physical contact between the fruit and the soil.
Phytophthora fruit and crown rot
This disease is caused by the organism Phytopthora capsici. Phytopthora is a
fungus-like organism that is in a separate kingdom than the fungi. It is a water-mold,
oomycete organism that has a mobile swimming-spore stage as part of it’s life cycle.
This particular disease is one of the most common and arguably the most destructive
of tomato in Georgia, rivaled only by bacterial spot and TSWV in order of importance
and yearly yield losses. Symptoms of Phytophthora fruit and crown rot are usually dead
or wilted plants that begin dying in the section of the field that is most poorly drained.
The crown region of the plant near the base is usually darkened, sunken and necrotic.
Vascular discoloration can be observed in tissues above the ground. The disease
generally spreads to other areas of the field through moving water (either irrigation or
rain), equipment or workers. The foliar and fruit phase of the disease is rarely observed in
Georgia. Control of Phytophthora fruit and crown rot is achieved by avoiding fields with
a history of the disease, both in tomato and other crops. If ponds are used for irrigation
they may be contaminated with the disease and should be identified and avoided.
Resistant varieties have recently been made available that show good to fair resistance to
this disease. Fungicide applications have been recommended and do show some benefits
but fungicide resistance problems coupled with the subterranean nature of the organism
hinder consistent performance of preventive or remedial fungicide treatments.
Pythium Damping-Off and Root Rot
Soilborne diseases like Pythium and Rhizoctonia can cause early season stand losses by
attacking the young, juvenile tissues and roots of young plants. In seedlings, a watery
soft-rot (Pythium) or a sunken, dark, dry lesion (Rhizoctonia) occurs at the soil line and
results in the wilting and sometimes sudden death of seedlings. Many times affected
roots appear dark and slough off easily when infected with Pythium.
These diseases are best controlled by using disease-free transplants, and rotating
tomatoes behind non-legume crops that tend to increase populations of both pathogens.
Other control measures are avoiding poorly drained fields, over-irrigation, and using
mefenoxam-containing fungicides (Pythium) or PCNB or azoxystrobin-containing
fungicides (Rhizoctonia) at or just prior to planting. Fumigation with methyl bromide,
chloropicrin, or metam sodium will reduce losses to these diseases as well.

Southern stem rot
Southern stem rot (Sclerotium rolfsii) is a common destructive disease of tomatoes in
Georgia. Since most tomatoes are rotated with peanuts, soybeans and other susceptible
crops, the disease has become a major problem. The fungus attacks the stem of the plant
near or at the soil line and forms a white mold on the stem. Later in the season, small,
round brown bodies appear in the mold. Infected plants wilt and slowly die. Vascular
discoloration can be observed on stem tissues above the lesion.
 49
The severity of this disease can be lessened by following good cultural practices: rotation,
litter destruction and deep turning with a moldboard plow are the best cultural defenses
against this disease. Fumigation as well as at-plant and drip-applied fungicides are also
effective in reducing losses to southern stem blight.
Recommended practices in chronological order are as follows:
1. Rotation with non-solanaceous crops reduces potential inoculum of all of the above
diseases.
2. Deep turning with a moldboard plow will help with all diseases except Pythium.
3. Plant varieties resistant to known Fusarium wilt races.
4. Fumigation with methyl bromide will suppress all soilborne diseases to some degree
but bacterial wilt and Fusarium wilt will continue to cause significant problems.
Alternatives to methyl bromide that suppress diseases are Telone C-35, K-Pam,
Vapam, and chloropicrin. Telone products are nematicidal. However, roots will
grow out of the treated zone and may still be susceptible to Fusarium wilt.
5. Terraclor can be used as an at-plant drench to suppress Southern stem rot.
6. Products containing mefenoxam (Ridomil, UltraFlourish) can suppress losses to
Pythium.
NEMATODES
Nematodes are small, slender, microscopic round worms which live in the soil. The rootknot nematode is the most common type affecting tomato in Georgia. If not managed,
this pest can cause serious damage in light, sandy-textured soils. Three species of RootKnot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita, M. hapla, M. arenaria) are the most damaging
on tomato in Georgia.
Symptoms
Root-knot nematodes enter young tomato feeder roots during their common feeding
process, causing the roots to swell. The most common below-ground symptom is the
formation of galls or knots on the roots. Nematode injury interferes with the uptake of
water and nutrients, thus giving the top portion of the plants an appearance which
resembles a lack of moisture or a fertilizer deficiency. Stunting, yellow, irregular growth
of plants in the field and rapid decline are also above ground symptoms of nematode
injury. Nematode feeding damage may also predispose plants to other soilborne diseases.
Management Options
Rotating tomato with a grass crop, such as rye, is somewhat beneficial in controlling rootknot, but this practice is no substitute for nematicidal fumigants if nematode levels are
high. Nematicides currently used are methyl bromide, Telone II, Telone C-35,
chloropicrin, and metam-sodium Depending on the weather, nematicidal fumigants must
be applied 10 days to 3 weeks prior to planting to avoid phytotoxicity to young tomato
plants. Oxamyl is a non-fumigant insecticide/nematicide that can be used at-planting and
post-planting on tomatoes but generally is not as suppressive against nematodes as
fumigants.

Tomato Weed Management General Overview
Stanley Culpepper
Department of Crop and Soil Sciences
University of Georgia
Effective weed management is one of many critical components of successful tomato
production in Georgia. Weeds compete with tomato for light, nutrients, water, and space
as well as interfere with harvesting practices. Additionally, weeds can harbor deleterious
insects and diseases. Severe weed infestations can reduce yield at least 50% even when
tomato are produced on plasticulture.
Weeds that usually cause problems in tomato are summer annual weeds including yellow
and purple nutsedge, morningglory, purslane, nightshade, pigweeds, and annual grasses.
One of the most effective tools for suppressing weeds in tomato is a healthy, vigorous
crop. Good crop management practices that result in rapid tomato canopy development
help minimize the effects of weeds.
Cultural Control Methods
Site selection can play a significant role in weed management. Rotation away from fields
infested with troublesome weeds, such as nutsedge, may minimize the presence of these
weeds and allow for the use of alternative crops and control methods. Additionally, so as
to prevent weed spread from field to field during harvest, equipment and personnel
should be cleaned when moving from heavily infested areas. This precaution can be of
significant consequence in preventing or minimizing the introduction of new weeds
species into ‘clean areas’.
Mechanical Control Methods
Mechanical control methods include field preparation by plowing or discing, cultivating,
mowing, hoeing and hand pulling of weeds. Most of Georgia’s and South Carolina’s
tomatoes are produced on mulch thereby limiting the practicality of most mechanical
control methods. Of course, hoeing and hand pulling of weeds is quite common. For
those growers producing tomato on bareground, mechanical control practices such as
cultivation and primary tillage are very beneficial for managing weeds.
Biological Controls
Biological controls do not exist at this time for weed pests of tomato common to Georgia.
 55
Mulching
The use of polyethylene mulch increases yield and earliness of vegetables. Mulches act
as a barrier to the growth of most weeds. Nutsedge, however, is one weed that can and
will penetrate through the mulch. Additionally, weeds that emerge in the transplant hole
will greatly reduce yield and quality of the crop. Thus, fumigants and or herbicides are
often used in conjunction with mulch.
Fumigants
Currently, methyl bromide is the fumigant of choice in tomato production because it is
extremely effective in controlling diseases, nematodes, and weeds and most growers are
comfortable applying this fumigant. Unfortunately, methyl bromide is being removed
from the market place. The University of Georgia has been and continues to conduct
many research trials searching for suitable methyl bromide alternatives. Large acreage
on farm trials evaluating potential alternatives began during 2006. Contact your local
extension office for up-to-date information on alternatives to methyl bromide. In general,
fumigants are restricted use chemicals and must be handled carefully by a certified
applicator. Apply all fumigants in full compliance with label recommendations and
precautions.
Herbicide Control Options

Stale Seedbed
Herbicide options in tomato are limited, thus, the use of a stale seedbed approach prior to
planting tomato on bareground or prior to transplanting into mulch can be useful. A stale
seedbed approach is one where the weeds are allowed to emerge and then treated with a
non-selective herbicide (glyphosate or paraquat usually) prior to planting. Both
glyphosate and paraquat can be removed from mulch with a rainfall or irrigation event of
at least 0.5 inch which must occur prior to planting.
Post Harvest Control Options
Glyphosate, paraquat, carfentrazone, and metam sodium are all used as post harvest tools
to manage both weeds and the previously grown tomato crop. The current program
recommended by the University of Georgia is an application of metam sodium injected
through drip irrigation followed by a topical application of glyphosate plus carfentrazone,
assuming drift issues are addressed properly. This program should provide the grower
with a clean plant bed for the following crop.
Weed Identification and Weed Species Commonly Found Throughout Georgia

Herbicide options are extremely limited in tomato because the potential for herbicide
injury and related liability issues far outweigh potential sales returns.

Tomato Weed Management Research, Regulatory and Education Priorities
Research
1) Herbicide resistance in weeds needs to be monitored and its distribution mapped
for the State.
2) Effect of methyl bromide alternatives on common weeds such as morning glory,
nutsedges, and pigweed (including new chemistries and tactics) needs research.
3) Science-based justification for fumigant use restrictions (buffers, etc) should be
further studied.
4) Geo-reference mapping of emerging pests (herbicide resistant and exotic weeds)
needs to be done in Georgia and South Carolina.
5) Weed host interaction with disease, insect, and nematode pests needs further
investigation to help with farmscape management.
6) Research for IR-4 labeling continues to be critical.
Regulatory
1) Pesticide regulators should consider new labeling requirements for the
management of herbicide resistance in the State.
2) Critical use exemptions should be continued for methyl bromide.
Education
1) Current information on tomato IPM for each State needs to be centrally linked on
a university maintained Tomato IPM website and then linked between States.
2) Web based or hard copies of pest identification are needed that are user friendly.
3) Fact sheets and training for resistance management (mode of action) especially
for glyphosate resistance are needed.
4) On-site extension visits including hands-on training needs to be expanded.
5) Maintain local-level (county) delivery system!

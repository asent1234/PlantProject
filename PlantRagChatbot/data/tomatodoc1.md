Seed Treatment. To minimize the occurrence of bacterial canker, bacterial spot, and bacterial speck, seed should be treated with chlorine. If seed is not treated with chlorine by the
seed company, then dip seed in a solution containing 1 quart of
household bleach and 4 quarts of water plus one-half teaspoon of
surfactant for 1 minute. Provide constant agitation. Use 1 gallon
of solution per pound of seed. Prepare a fresh solution for each
batch of seed. Wash seed in running water for 5 minutes and dry
seed thoroughly. The final rinse should be done with acidified
water (1 oz. vinegar per gallon of water). Further information on
seed treatments can be found under SEED TREATMENTS in
the disease management section of the handbook.

Using transplants. Note: Planting dates in the spring could be earlier if low
tunnels or other season extension measures are used in some locations.
NR = Not recommended
Hardening Transplants. It is usually desirable to harden
tender tomato seedlings before planting them in the field. Recent
research has shown that hardening tomato plants by exposure to
cool temperatures (60° to 65°F/day and 50°to 60°F/night) for a
week or more causes catfacing. Harden plants by withholding
water. Allow plants to wilt slightly between light waterings. Do
not harden transplants by withholding fertilizer.
Drip Fertilization. Fertigation should be based on a soil test,
adjust soil pH to 6.5 and, in the absence of a soil test, apply
enough fertilizer to supply 50 pounds per acre of N, P2
O5
 and
K2
O, (some soils will require 100 pounds per acre of K2
O) then
thoroughly incorporate into the soil.
After mulching and installing the drip irrigation system, the
soluble fertilizer program should be initiated according to the
following table. On soils testing low to low-medium boron, also
include 0.5 pound per acre of actual boron.
The first soluble fertilizer application should be applied
through the drip irrigation system within a week after field-transplanting the tomatoes. Continue fertigating until the last harvest.

Fresh Market. Yield, fruit size, and fruit quality of fresh market
tomatoes are increased by the use of black plastic mulch in combination with drip irrigation. When air temperature exceed 85°F
use white on black plastic mulch, or paint black plastic with a
5:1 (v/v) mixture of exterior, flat white latex paint and water.
Form-raised, dome-shaped beds to aid in disease control. Lay
black plastic mulch tightly over the beds.
Grafting and Diseases. In recent years, grafted tomato plants
have emerged as a strategy to combat soilborne diseases, particularly in heirloom varieties. Grafting is used against diseases such as Bacterial wilt, Fusarium wilt, and Verticillium wilt.
Grafted plants are more expensive per transplant. For more
information, see the section Grafting in Vegetable Crops in this
handbook.
Greenhouse Tomatoes. While there are thousands of tomato
varieties on the market, only a few are suitable for growing in
greenhouses. If you plan on growing tomatoes to maturity in the
greenhouse, you need to select a greenhouse variety. This is because these varieties have been bred specifically for greenhouse
conditions – lower light, higher humidity and temperature, etc.,
and have better disease resistance than field types. Nearly all
greenhouse varieties are indeterminate hybrids so that they will
yield over a long harvest season. While non-greenhouse types
would grow in the greenhouse, the yield and quality would be
reduced, and therefore they may not be profitable.
Variety selection is based on yield, fruit size, uniformity,
disease resistance, and lack of physiological disorders, as well as
the market demand for the type of tomato grown. For suggestions on varieties, see the variety table in this section above. Insect and disease control methods for greenhouse vegetables can
be found in Tables 2-29 and 3-45 (Insect and Diseases Control
sections), respectively. For further information on greenhouse
tomato production, see 
Ground Culture. Space determinate varieties in rows 4 to 5 feet
apart with plants 18 to 24 inches apart in the row. For indeterminate varieties, space rows 5 to 6 feet apart with plants 24 to 36
inches apart in the row.
Stake Culture. Staking tomatoes is a highly specialized production system. The following recommendations are for the shortstake cultural system using determinate cultivars that grow 3 to 4
feet in height or for indeterminate varieties that grow 6 to 7 feet
in height. Use between row spacings of 5 to 6 feet with in-row
spacings of 18 to 24 inches. See state specific guides for a full
description of staking.
Pruning/Suckering: Pruning is practiced to establish a desired
balance between vine growth and fruit growth. Little to no pruning results in a plant with a heavy load of smaller fruit. Moderate
pruning results in fewer fruits that are larger and easier to harvest. Pruning can result in earlier maturity of the crown fruit and
improves spray coverage and pest control.
Removing all suckers up to the one immediately below the
first flower cluster is adequate for most determinate cultivars.
Removing the sucker immediately below the first flower cluster
or pruning above the first flower cluster can result in severe leaf
curling and stunting of the plant and should be avoided.
Prune when the suckers are no more than 2 to 4 inches long.
A second pruning may be required to remove suckers that are
too small to be easily removed during the first pruning and to
remove ground suckers that may develop. Pruning when suckers
are too large requires more time and can damage the plants, delay maturity, and increase disease incidence. Do not prune plants
when they are wet to avoid spread of diseases. Pruning should
be done before the first stringing because the string can slow the
pruning process. Pruning is variety-and fertility-dependent.
Less-vigorous determinate cultivars generally require less
pruning. Growers should experiment with several degrees of
pruning on a small scale to determine pruning requirements for
specific cultivars and cultural practices.
Staking: Staking improves fruit quality by keeping plants and
fruit off the ground and providing better spray coverage. Staked
tomatoes are easier to harvest than ground tomatoes.
Staking tomatoes consists of a series of wooden stakes with
twine woven around the stakes to train the plants to grow vertically off the ground. Stakes 4 to 4.5-feet long by 1-inch square
are driven about 12 inches into the soil between the plants.
Vigorous cultivars may require larger and longer stakes. A
stake placed between every other plant is adequate to support
most determinate varieties. Placing an additional stake at an
angle and tied to the end stake of each section will strengthen
the trellis system. Stakes can be driven by hand with a home-
2023 Vegetable Crop Handbook for Southeastern United States 113
made driving tool or with a commercially available, power-driven stake driving tool. Drive stakes to a consistent depth so that
spray booms can be operated in the field without damaging the
trellis system.
Select “tomato twine” that is resistant to weathering and
stretching and that binds well to the wooden stakes. Tomato
twine is available in 3- to 4-pound boxes. Approximately 30
pounds of twine is required per acre. To make tying convenient,
use a homemade stringing tool. This tool can be made from a
length of metal conduit, schedule 40 PVC pipe, broom handle,
or wooden dowel. With conduit and PVC pipe, the string is fed
through the pipe. With a broom handle or wooden dowel, two
small parallel holes, each about 1 inch from the end, must be
drilled to feed the string through one hole along the length of the
tool and through the other hole. The tool serves as an extension
of the worker’s arm (the length cut to the worker’s preference)
and helps to keep the string tight.
Proper stringing consists of tying the twine to an end stake
passing the string along one side of the plants, and then looping
the twine around each stake until the end of a row or section
(100-foot sections with alleys may be helpful for harvesting) is
reached. The same process is continued on the other side of the
row. The string tension must be tight enough to hold the plants
upright. Note: If strings are too tight, they can make harvesting
fruit difficult and can scar fruit.
The first stringing should be strung 8 to 10 inches above
the ground when plants are 12 to 15 inches tall and before they
fall over. Run the next string 6 to 8 inches above the preceding
string before plants start to fall over. Three to four stringings are
required for most determinate varieties. Stringing should be done when the foliage is dry to prevent the spread of diseases.
Heirloom Tomatoes. Heirloom tomatoes are varieties that have
been available for 50 years or more, are open pollinated, and
grow “true to type” from seed saved from fruit each year. They
are generally indeterminate, requiring trellising and constant
pruning. Most varieties have little disease resistance. The fruit
are usually thin-skinned, soft, and tend to crack. Consumers
are attracted to heirloom tomatoes because many varieties are
very flavorful, colorful, come in many sizes and shapes, and
have interesting names. For the growers, heirloom tomatoes are
challenging to produce and difficult to ship, but can bring high
prices on the local market.
There are hundreds of varieties of heirloom tomatoes available. Some of the most popular varieties include Brandywine,
German Johnson, Mr. Stripey, Cherokee Carbon, Cherokee Purple, and Green Zebra.
Because most heirloom tomatoes are indeterminate, they
must be grown on a tall, strong trellis. A trellis can be constructed of 3 inch diameter, or larger, posts set 10-15 feet apart within
the row. Use 7-8 ft. long posts, leaving 6-7 ft. above ground.
Run a stout wire (12 gauge) across the tops of the posts and secure it with staples. Pieces of twine, long enough to reach the
ground, should be tied to the top wire above each plant. The
twine can be anchored with a loop to each plant or to a bottom line of twine that is strung about 6 in. off the ground and
secured to the posts. Some growers use the standard string and
weave-staked culture system for heirloom tomatoes, as described for the determinate tomatoes, but they use 6-ft. long
stakes instead of the normal 4-ft. long stakes.
In a trellis system, plants are usually spaced 8-10 in. apart
within the row and pruned to a single stem system. A two stem
system may also be used, in which the plants should be spaced
18-30 in. apart within the row. If using a standard staking system, plants should be spaced 18-24 in. apart. Once the plants are
established, suckers must be removed several times a week. If
the main growing point is broken off, a sucker can be trained to
take its place.
Because most heirloom tomatoes have little disease resistance, it is important to maintain a good fungicide spray
schedule. For organic production, it might be necessary to grow
heirloom tomatoes under high tunnels, especially in areas with
high disease pressure. Grafting heirloom varieties onto diseases
resistant rootstocks might also increase your success at growing
organically.
TOMATO DISORDERS
Your local county Extension office has bulletins that describe
fruit disorders in detail. Here are several common disorders of
tomato and their causes: catfacing (cool day and/or night temperatures or very hot dry days), internal browning, graywall
and blotchy ripening, (tobacco mosaic virus, overcast cloudy
environment, high N, low K or soil compaction), yellow shoulder (direct sun exposure, worse on green shouldered varieties), sunburn and sunscald (direct rapid exposure to the sun),
weathercheck (fruit exposed to dew), blossom end rot (low
soil calcium and/or soil moisture), cracking (variety, irregular
water, growth, and/or nutrition). Check out the following link
for images and discussions for several common problems in tomato production --

SPECIAL NOTES ON PEST MANAGEMENT
INSECT MANAGEMENT
Colorado Potato Beetle (CPB), Flea Beetles (FB): While flea
beetles are a common pest of tomato throughout the southeastern US, Colorado potato beetle are most common in areas where
significant acreage of potatoes is also grown. Flea beetles are
primarily a problem early in the season shortly after planting,
and are usually controlled by insecticides applied for other insects. Adults feed on foliage, resulting in small round holes on
leaves. In most situations this damage does not affect early season growth or subsequent yields, but control may be necessary
when populations are high (20-30% defoliation).
Colorado potato beetle adults and larvae feed on tomato foliage and can cause extensive defoliation if not controlled. CPB
feed only on solanaceous plants, and populations tend to be concentrated in areas where potato, eggplant and tomato have previously been grown. Consequently, rotation to non-solanaceous
crops is very effective in helping to avoid infestations. Thoroughly scout fields and spray only when necessary. Treatment
should be made if populations exceed 15 adults per 10 plants
114 2023 Vegetable Crop Handbook for Southeastern United States
or a combination of 20 CPB larvae and/or adults per 10 plants.
Insecticide sprays should be made after most egg masses have
hatched, but before larvae become large. CPB have developed
resistance to many different insecticides, so knowledge of the
resistance status of populations is essential in choosing which
insecticides to use.
Tomato Fruitworm: The tomato fruitworm, also known as the
corn earworm and cotton bollworm, is potentially the most damaging pest of tomato. However, there are many insecticides that
provide excellent control. The key to controlling this insect is to
ensure that there is a toxic pesticide residue on the plant during
egg laying periods so that larvae are killed shortly after hatching,
because larvae feed on leaf tissue for only a short time before
boring into fruit. Tomato fruitworm moth activity can be monitored with pheromone traps and serves as a measure of the adult
population within an area. Corn that is in the silking stage is a
preferred host of fruitworm, but when corn silks begins to dry,
moths will switch egg laying to other hosts, including tomato.
Armyworms: At least three species of armyworms are potential
pests of tomato, including the beet armyworm, southern armyworm and yellowstriped armyworm. Infestations are usually
sporadic in the more northern regions of the southeastern US,
but are an annual problem in more southern areasw. In contrast
to tomato fruitworm, armyworms will also feed extensively on
foliage as well as fruit, and the presence of feeding damage on
leaves can help differentiate between fruitworm and armyworm
damage. Beet armyworm is notorious for exhibiting resistance to
a wide range of insecticides, but the recent registration of newer
insecticides has greatly aided the management of this pest.
Tomato Pinworm: The tomato pinworm is more common in the
southern compared with northern regions of the southeast, but
late-season infestations are common in northern areas. Moths lay
eggs on foliage, and larvae feed within leaves, creating blotchy
mines. As larvae increase in age they bore into stems and/or
fruit. The use of pheromone-based mating disruption is an effective control method. Initiate mating disruption at the first sign of
mines on foliage. Numerous insecticides also control pinworm.
Stink Bugs: The green and brown stink bug can be important
direct pests of tomato, but they are sporadic in occurrence. Stink
bugs are most common in smaller fields (i.e., 5 acres or less)
that are surrounded by weedy borders, or fields that are adjacent
to soybeans. In fact, chemical control of stink bugs is often not
necessary in fields that do not fit the previous description. Unfortunately, there is not a good sampling method to assess population densities before damage occurs, and preventive strategies
are used. Depending on the surrounding habitat and abundance
of stink bugs within an area, one to three applications of an insecticide are necessary to prevent damage.
Thrips: Thrips can cause direct damage to tomato fruit by their
feeding or oviposition scars on small fruits, and are also indirect
pests of tomato due to their ability to transmit tomato spotted
wilt virus (TSWV). The tobacco thrips and western flower thrips
are vectors of tomato spotted wilt virus. The majority of virus
infections are the result of primary spread (thrips transmitting
the virus from surrounding weeds directly to tomatoes), and insecticides do not kill thrips quickly enough to prevent inoculation. However, an aggressive early insecticide control program
early in the season (3 to 4 weeks after transplanting) and the
use of reflective mulches have helped to reduce the incidence of
TSWV in tomatoes. Thrips can also cause direct damage to tomato fruit. This is the result of thrips feeding and/or laying eggs
in small fruits before stamens are shed from flowers. This damage appears as small dimples in fruit. Sample thrips in tomato
flowers by placing a white index card below flowers and tapping
the flowers with a finger. An average of 1 thrips per flower has
worked well as a treatment threshold level.
Whiteflies: The greenhouse whitefly and silverleaf whitefly can
both infest tomatoes in the southeast. Generally, the silverleaf
whitefly is more common in the southern region and the greenhouse whitefly is more common in the northern region of the
southeast. Once whitefly populations of either species become
established on a crop, they are very difficult to control. Therefore, preventive control is usually necessary for effective, season-long management. Preventive control can be achieved with
soil-applied systemic insecticides or the application of other insecticides when populations are low.
Mites: Mites have become an increasingly important problem on
tomatoes and other vegetables grown in the southeast. Twospotted spider mite is the most common mite pest, but the broad mite
and carmine spider mite can also infest tomatoes. Mites overwinter on weeds and move into tomatoes in the spring as weeds
die. Mites can also move from other crops (including other
tomato fields) into tomatoes throughout the season. Localized
infestations can be spot treated, but thorough coverage of foliage is important. Mites can be sampled by using a sample of 10
leaflets (terminal leaflet on a leaf from the upper one-third of the
plant), from a minimum of 5 sample sites per field. When mites
reach an average of 2 mites/leaflet, a miticide should be applied.
Note that certain pesticides, such as pyrethroids and some neonictinoids, aggravate mite populations and can lead to high mite
densities.
DISEASE MANAGEMENT
A. Keinath, Plant Pathologist, Clemson University and R.
A. Melanson, Extension Plant Pathologist, Mississippi State
University
Accurate diagnosis is necessary for effective disease management. Incorporate appropriate and effective cultural practices
and pesticides, as detailed in the Disease Management section,
in a season-long integrated disease management program.
Soil-borne Diseases (bacterial wilt, Fusarium wilt, southern
blight, etc.): Several soil-borne bacterial, fungal, and oomycete
pathogens can significantly affect tomatoes. Many are difficult to
manage when fields become infested. When possible, use resistant varieties or rootstocks. Limited fumigants and fungicides are
available for some diseases. Pathogens can be spread via move-
2023 Vegetable Crop Handbook for Southeastern United States 115
ment of contaminated soil, water, and equipment/tools. Clean
and disinfest tools when moving between fields, when possible.
Direct water flow away from other fields and sources of surface
water for irrigation. Practice appropriate crop rotations with nonhost crops.
Foliar and Fruit Diseases: Many foliar and fruit diseases are
caused by bacterial, fungal, and oomycete pathogens. Use cultural practices that minimize water splash, leaf wetness, and canopy density, which contribute to pathogen infection and spread.
Resistant varieties are available for some diseases, including early blight, gray leaf spot, late blight, and leaf mold. Preventative,
season-long spray programs using products from multiple FRAC
groups should be implemented prior to the development of
symptoms and in conjunction with appropriate cultural practices.
Viruses: Once plants become infected with a virus, they cannot
be cured. Chemicals are not an effective management option for
virus infections. Many viruses are transmitted by insects, such
as aphids (TMV, CMV, TEV), thrips (TSWV), and whiteflies
(TYLCV), and can cause significant losses in tomatoes. Other
viruses may be mechanically- or seed-transmitted. Use resistant
varieties, when available, to manage viruses in areas where they
are prevalent or when high insect vector pressure is expected.
Generally, aphid-transmitted viruses cannot be adequately managed with insecticide applications; however, appropriately timed
insecticide applications can be an effective in the management of
thrips- and whitefly-transmitted viruses. Use of reflective mulches may help with aphid-transmitted viruses. Avoid using tobacco
products in operations producing TMV- or ToMV-susceptible varieties. Purchase seeds from reputable sources, and do not save
seeds from diseased plants.
Nematodes: Various root-knot nematodes, such as the southern root-knot and guava root-knot, as well as other nematodes
can infect tomatoes. Nematode infection may predispose plants
to other soil-borne diseases, such as Fusarium crown and root
rot, Fusarium wilt, and Phytophthora root rot. Sample fields the
previous year when nematodes are active (late-summer or fall).
Some varieties and rootstocks have resistance to the southern
root-knot nematode and should be used in infested fields. Clean
and disinfest equipment between fields. Use appropriate crop rotations and cover crops with non-host crops to reduce nematode
populations. Use appropriate fumigants and other nematicides
for management (see fumigant and nematicide tables).
Postharvest Diseases: Many postharvest diseases are the result
of field infections. Harvest and cool fruits in a timely manner.
Avoid harvesting overripe or damaged fruit. Handle fruits carefully. Follow appropriate storage conditions. See the postharvest
